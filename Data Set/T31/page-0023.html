                  <p><strong>Although I liked it, it shouldve been what The Dark Knight
                  was, a sequel better than the 1st.</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>For me, Iron Man II was one of the most anticipated movies of
                  theyear for me.Given the fact that the first was sensational, I just
                  knewthis would be excellent, and maybe better than the first.Well,
                  thatswhat I thought.I have good news and bad news for this movie.The
                  goodnews is that Iron Man II is a solid movie, no doubt.I
                  enjoyedit.Theres no reason to not see it.Its a solid piece of
                  2-hourentertainment.The bad news is that it was too talkative.I really
                  hateto tell this to people going into this movie looking for
                  non-stopaction, but theres only 3, count em 3, major action sequences
                  in theentire movie.2 are serious and quite effective while one is
                  playedmostly for comic relief, and I enjoyed it for its sheer
                  goofiness.Theproblem with it is that there is too much talking between
                  the action.IfI could estimate, Id say theres about 20 to 25 minutes of
                  actionthrough out the whole movie.The other 90 minutes are nothing bu
                  talk,talk, talk.Im not saying I was bored, Im just saying that
                  therecouldve been more cool action sequences.Maybe 2 more wouldnt
                  havehurt.Those looking for the same level of entertainment as the
                  firstmight be a little disappointed.So I would recommend that you dont
                  seeit with high expectations.But I am recommending Iron Man 2 for
                  thecool special effects, the iron man suits, and Robert Downey
                  Jr.sperformance.A solid, but not excellent, sequel.</p>

                  <p><strong>Iron Man 2 Movie Review</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>Iron Man 2, arguably one of the most anticipated movies of the
                  summer,opens next week. And with its opening, the summer blockbuster
                  seasonstarts in earnest. And I was so excited, I took a relatively long
                  tripto see this movie early. And what a way to start off the movie
                  season. The first Iron Man movie, I think, came as a surprise to many
                  moviefans. Yes, as a member of the Avengers, Iron Man is important in
                  theMarvel Comics Universe, but usually takes a back seat to the
                  IncredibleHulk, Captain America, the X-Men, and of course, Spider-Man.
                  But the first Iron Man movie was comic book perfection. Short of
                  theDark Knight and possibly Spider-Man 2, it may have been the
                  bestsuperhero movie ever, depending on who is making the argument. It
                  tooka relatively unknown character in Robert Downey Jr.s portrayal of
                  theself-loathing, narcissistic playboy billionaire Tony Stark, and
                  broughtthe story t the masses. The introduction story was ideal in
                  every way.And Starks progression from a selfish genius to a superhero
                  is unlikemost we see in movies. And taking that all into consideration,
                  it is incredible that Iron Man2 out duels its predecessor. More at

                  <p><strong>A superb super hero movie (finaly someone who gets it
                  right)</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>Hulk was good, spider-man was better, but IRON MAN tops them all!
                  and in almost every way story-wise, acting-wise, actual good comedy the
                  others had their moments but they lacked the biting wit this one
                  delivered, almost everything is likable about this movie. I really hope
                  part 2 is coming out they need to make more superhero based movies like
                  this not merely iron man, but a plethora of others Thor would be great,
                  Black Panther would be great, Captain America would be awesome, their
                  is far too many to name but bottom line - this is an excellent super
                  hero movie and if you gave it less then 5 stars somethings wrong with
                  you! (just kidding)no, but seriously you might need your head
                  checked.</p>

                  <p><strong>Great example of Blue Ray, good example of a
                  film</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>With the price of Blue Ray discs so high I have found myself renting
                  more than buying but there are a few titles out there whose rental
                  convinces me that they are worth spending a little extra. Ironman is an
                  excellent example of the power of blue ray, an extremely polished film
                  and one that looks absolutely stunning on Blue Ray. As a movie I have
                  found myself rewatching the first hour more than the second. As with
                  any comic book origin story you learn where the hero comes from, what
                  pushes him to risking his life for others, and a little about where he
                  is going. The interesting thing with this film is that it is far
                  stronger in its early stages when we are learning these facets of our
                  hero than it is after the hero has been constructed (literally in this
                  case). It almost feels as though once the premise is all in place the
                  writers were not really sure what to do with him so they fabricated a
                  quick enemy for him to fight. As an origin story though it is very
                  engaging. So after we have discovered the why and the who behind our
                  superhero there needs to be a super villain standing in opposition and
                  this is where I think the movie falters a little. I got a trifle bored
                  in the last quarter of the movie once the villain of the piece has been
                  revealed. I almost wish they had have ended the story after the origin
                  part was over and spent more time in a sequal on setting up a major
                  villain. Here is hoping that ironman 2 gives us a more convincing
                  nemesis.</p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>This IRON TURKEY isnt a flick youre likely to want to view twice.
                  Oh, it may well be a reasoable or even a competent recreation of a
                  Marvel Comic strip Superhero, I dont know because prior to the films
                  publicity I was unfamiliar with the Superhero. But, the publicity
                  campaign was effective and the effort was touted as having been
                  produced with a high level of artistic skill and vision. Nevertheless,
                  five or ten minutes of viewing time, showed the effort to be
                  considerably below the level of other recent films in the
                  CapeActionSuperhero genre. It was patently inferior to HELLBOY, for
                  example, on every level. Or the latest BATMAN. Whats it about? Not
                  much. The first fifteen minutes of the film is so dark and the sound is
                  so confused and muddy, one sits stymied, wondering what comes next. All
                  this takes place somwhere in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area. An
                  American arms manufacturer is captured by terrorists of some sort, who
                  live in caves. (All very well played and costumed, by the way most
                  effective.) They want this man, Tony Stark of Stark Munitions, to make
                  a guided missle for them. Tony has been seriously wounded and now wears
                  a sort of big flashlight diode aray where his sternum ought to be.
                  (Idiotic justification.) Aided by a doomed multi-lingual individual of
                  uncertain origin -- who is somewhat interesting in spite of the
                  far-fetched and murky dialogue -- Stark builds a self-powered,
                  napalm-spurting flying suit of armor, and escapes the cave. He crashes
                  in the desert and is promptly picke up by American copters. Next, he
                  has a one-line epiphany on his way home, which he announces at an
                  impromptu news conference. He intends to lead Stark Enterprises out of
                  the munitions business. Into what, everyone wants to know? I dont know
                  yet, he replies. Now here we have to pay close attention to Jeff
                  Bridges as he proceeds to fold the movie up, stick it in his breast
                  pocket and walk away with it. Hes absolutely terrific the best thing in
                  the movie, by far, playing the role Kris Kristoffersen aced often, and
                  last for Wesley Snipes that of the substitute father-figure. Here hes
                  Big Daddy Warbucks with a shaved head and white beard, sporting good
                  suits and an enormous cigar. A baddie too, for all the difference it
                  makes. But so good and so likeable you yearn to see him from scene to
                  scene until, at the very end, he re-appears driving and wearing a
                  super-flying enhanced armored suit to battle the smaller Tony character
                  in his smaller suit its like the mano-a-mano last scene in ROBOCOP as
                  the good Humanist Robo battles the bad Corporate Robo. Not better, just
                  similar. Second best? Gwenneth Paltrow with a discreetly padded chest,
                  sporting an orange wig and the highest possible stilettoes. She has
                  nothing to work with, character-wise or script-wise, but manages to
                  create the impression that she endures labial seizures every time her
                  co-star comes near to her. Its a feat of acting ability and almost
                  comic, because Downey never does anything that even remotely suggests
                  any degree of physical intimacy. Endlessly condescending, he ignores
                  her and talks over her constantly. Cold and narcissistic, he touches
                  her once when they briefly dance together for a few seconds. Prior to
                  this, she does what Lois Stewart did as Miss Moneypenny in the JAMES
                  BOND Series, rolling her eyes and appearing to ooze as Bond passes by.
                  BACK TO THE PLOT. Whats Tony up to? After his vapid revelation? Hes at
                  work in the billionaireis workshop - garage under his huge billionaires
                  hilltop Malibu cottage, re-fashioning a better version of the iron suit
                  he made whilst among the brigands. Very flashy toys on display. Virtual
                  this and that. Flashy cars. Flashy welding and tooling equipment. Super
                  electronics to handle his secret Power Source. Tedium. Meanwhile, Daddy
                  Warbucks reveals himself as working to take over STARK ENTERPRISES for
                  himself. Purpose? To sell the newest munitions to the insurgents in the
                  hills. Tony finds out and flies -- thats right, flies to Afghanistan --
                  and Flying ROBOCOP blasts the baddies himself by means of the diodes in
                  his palms and on the soles of his feet. He is attacked by jet planes,
                  but escapes. And then, finally, he meets his nemesis at Stark Labs
                  Headquarters and they fight it out. Well, if you enjoy this genre of
                  action movies -- capes and gadgets and super-powers -- you accept the
                  improbabilites that go along with the fantasies. And, you have your
                  roster of favorite stars, and you might have wondered how it came about
                  that Robert downey Jr got cast in the role? Especially when theres
                  Dwayne The Rock Johnson, Vin Diesel or Wesley Snipes. And thats just
                  the Americans. Unless you figure theyd be an ethnic stretch for the
                  story. But then theres Christian Bale, Patrick Swayze, Orlando Bloom or
                  even Mat Damon and Ben Afflek. And from the set-up, one wonders if IRON
                  MAN might not have been intended for Afflek or Damon? La Paltrow is a
                  personal friend of both men and has appeared with them both in various
                  films. Afflek did well in DAREDEVIL, which did well at the Box Office.
                  Did he tire of the tights and pulleys and wires? Or did Damon commit,
                  and then refuse at the last minute, or after reading the script?
                  Leaving... Gweneth, and crew. Money talks, or in this case, it keeps
                  mum. The project is odd, yet conventional, without being entertaining
                  in an unconventional way. It gave off the feeling of having been
                  stitched together out of whole pieces of comic book and monster movie
                  cliches. Downey doing his red carpet celebrity walk through the crowds
                  while not speaking to anybody directly -- which he did so perfectly in
                  SOAP DISH, one of the best Show-Biz comedies of the 80s -- in imitation
                  of Bruce Wayne many entries and exits in all of the latest BATMAN
                  flicks. But why Downey, particularly? And what about DOWNEY anyway?
                  Well, since his publicized recouperation, it is obvious that the course
                  of treatment involved an intense regimen of body-building, for the
                  actor has managed to become an obvious Gym-Rat, and Gym-Rats have
                  something in common with Downs syndrome people. As Downs sufferers
                  share a round-faced, slant-eyed asian appearance, so Gym-Rats share a
                  gaunt, sunken-cheeked volpine resemblence that makes them look like
                  brothers. Astonishingly, Downey with his pitch black hair, thick browns
                  and inky moustache and goatee, has become the identical twin of
                  venerable Gay porn performer and total Gym Rat, Jason Probe aka Joshua
                  Perez. Well, let me put it to you this way Downey is rather a small,
                  compact man. Everybody in the entire movie is bigger than he is, and
                  some tower over him. This is a very odd handicap for a Superhero. Which
                  makes me wonder why anybody would cast this movie in that way? What is
                  the point? The Mighty Mouse effect. It trivializes everything the hero
                  does. And if Mr. Downeys height wasnt a consideration in the casting of
                  this movie, why would any producer hire the same casting people to do
                  another job? This is a re-hash of the old BULLETMAN strip. But, as I
                  say. Look at it once and return it the next day. Its good for a bag of
                  popcorn.</p>

                  (I think that is his name)plays as Iron Man. He does such a good job

                  voice of Megatron, supplied the voice for the bad robot. I heard plenty
                  of rock in this movie, but I didnt hear any cussing. if I had kids, I

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>Iron-Man doesnt mess it up when it could have been easy to do so and
                  Robert Downey Jr is on top form in a story about him being a
                  multi-billionaire weapons tycoon who finds his products used against
                  Americans and so develops an Iron-Man suit to combat Muslim terrorists
                  that kidnapped him, killed his friend and tried to use his technology
                  in ways that he didnt foresee. Things go from bad to worse when he
                  finds his company has been double-dealing and business partners have
                  turned bad. In short Iron-Man is Robocop for young adults but Downey Jr
                  actually puts on a worthwhile performance that overshadows when he puts
                  on the suit. Even with the suit on the flying through the sky moments
                  are well worth the wait and while the fights and finale are kept on a
                  somewhat small scale they are still good. Overall Iron-Man delivers on
                  an interesting balance of action and content. If you like quality
                  superhero movies then you cant go wrong with this.</p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>Iron Man entertains exceedingly well thanks to the jovial
                  performance of Robert Downey Jr. While his song Your Move from the
                  4-year old CD The Futurist is just now in my personal top ten sounding
                  like a new record from Yes, I picked up a copy of Iron Man for my rainy
                  day video shelf. Downey was nominated for an Oscar in 1992 for Chaplin
                  and for a Golden Globe in 2000 for TVs Ally McBeal. As weapons dealer
                  Tony Stark, he moves from the hard-nosed wheeler dealer to a man with a
                  conscience. I understood why Jeff Bridges character Obadiah Stane would
                  want to remove him after he has a conscience, but wasnt altogether
                  clear why he wanted to get rid of Tony when he was a money maker.
                  Perhaps it was jealousy. The great humor that Downey brings to the
                  role, particularly with his eccentric machine that keeps wanting to
                  spray him to put out fires, makes the action all the better. There is
                  also a hint of romance with Pepper Potts played by Oscar winner Gwyneth
                  Paltrow for 1998s Shakespeare in Love. Terrence Howard has been a
                  favorite actor of mine since Crash (Widescreen Edition) and his
                  Oscar-nominated role in Hustle Flow (Widescreen Edition). Perhaps one
                  of the best parts is played by Shaun Toub who shined in the Oscar
                  winning Crash as the Iranian store clerk. In captivity, Stark meets
                  Toubs Yinsen who becomes his assistant and sacrifices himself for Tony.
                  Faran Tahir as the rebel leader Raza is excellent. John Favreau who is
                  currently acting in Four Christmases directs the film and keeps the
                  pace breakneck. This is a great actionspecial effects picture.

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>Now here is a comic book movie. They didnt mess too much with the
                  costume, it didnt take itself waaaay too serious and it stayed fairly
                  faithful to the source material. Plus we got that real cool set up for
                  the Avengers. When I saw the movie in the theatre all the fanboys went
                  nuts for that little bit at the end of the credits, and I was impressed
                  too. I wish I had thought of it. Downey Jr. is great as Stark (unlike
                  Christian Bale with that silly diguised voice.) It shows that you can
                  stay pretty faithful to the source material and still make a good film.
                  It pleased the fans AND the general audience, AND it really was Iron
                  man. Not a guy in an armored batsuit who usually has the intellect of
                  Sherlock Holmes but (in this movie version) gets others to do his
                  thinking for him. Oh right.... that was another summer film. Iron man
                  was the film of the summer as far as I am concerned.</p>

                  <p><strong>Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>WARNING SPOILERS WARNING On the surface the script for Iron Man is
                  simple and basic. We find out the origin of Iron Man, how he builds the
                  suit and a major villain arrives with a similar suit to challenge him.
                  Iron Man saves the day etc. rinse repeat. What makes this comic book
                  movie great and one of the best adaptations of all time is 1 thing.
                  Robert Downey Jr. I had been a comic book fan since I was a kid, and
                  while I mainly collected Spider-Man, I knew Iron Man and his back
                  story. I knew him but never really was into him except when the story
                  revolved around Tony Stark and his personal life. While usually the
                  book is better than the movie, this is one of those rare exceptions
                  where the real life version far exceeds the book. Quite simply, like
                  Heath Ledger as The Joker, you dont see Downey Jr. on the screen but
                  Tony Stark. Yes, hes that good. Whoever casted Downey for this movie
                  deserves a raise or of the profits because without him the movie doesnt
                  excel. Yes the CGI is fantastic but the other people cast in the movie
                  dont inspire the audience. Paltrow is fine, Howard I thought was good
                  (bad move replacing a decent character who wanted to return for the
                  sequel with Don Cheadle as good as he is), Bridges is very good but
                  this movie belongs to Downey Jr. Sometimes a basic script can be made
                  exceptional when you find a definitive actor to play a role. Not only
                  will this film make comic book fans happy, it is perfect for both
                  genders, all ages, or anyone that likes movies in general. One of the
                  greatest comic book movies of all time and a joy to watch that
                  instantly ranks in the top 5 of said adaptations ever made. HIGHEST
                  POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION</p>

                  <p>Im biased. I loved the film, and saw it twice at the theatre. Downey
                  was a surprise casting decision for me, but it works perfectly. He
                  brings an attitude and maturity that a younger man would not have had.
                  The film succeeds better than most comic book adaptations by not trying
                  too hard to be cool. There is a realism in the narrative that is
                  subtle, but effective. Luckily, even though its an FX driven film, its
                  not edited in a way that draws your attention to them. That being said,
                  the FX are INCREDIBLE. The final fight is fairly anti-climactic. BUT
                  its AWESOME from start to finish. Great funny gratuitous action.</p>

                  of the best, out of all the comic-book-to-big-screen releases. Dark

                  <p><strong>Iron Man--Works...And Then Some</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>Many of the Marvel Films projects--outside of the Spider-Man (thus
                  far) trilogy--have met with some very mixed results and reviews. One is
                  left wondering if Marvel has rushed their Universe out there too
                  quickly. Certainly, Iron Man--given to Jon Favreau to direct, and the
                  controversial decision to go with Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark--left
                  many pondering if the right decisions were made in production and
                  casting. Well...THAT WAS SETTLED. What we found out was that RDJ was
                  not just a good pick, but a GREAT pick to play the hard-partying,
                  hard-drinking weapons manufacturer who, when captured by terrorists who
                  want him to make a weapon, comes up with a Ned Kelly-like suit of iron
                  (The suit us fanboys recognize as the original Iron Man suit), and
                  proceeds to get medieval on the terrorist encampment. There were many
                  who thought that Oded Fehr (Of The Mummy and Resident Evil movies) was
                  the more likely choice to be Stark, but RDJ--and his own personal
                  history with alcohol and drugs cant be dismissed in this casting--is
                  nothing short of brilliant. At points, RDJ does his usual fast-paced
                  one liners and makes them part of Stark, but there are points
                  that--with the epiphany his character has about 40 minutes in--that
                  Downey becomes the performer we saw in Chaplin. The casting is
                  incredibly solid--Gwynneth Paltrows return to work as Pepper Potts,
                  Jeff Bridges take on Obidiah Stane, and Terrence Howards military
                  liason to Stark, James Rhodes...plus, we can all see the sequel (or
                  sequels) being set up through the movie--Howards looking at the second
                  suit and saying someday... prepares us for War Machine, and the
                  terrorist organization that captures Stark--the Ten Rings--is an
                  obvious reference to The Mandarin... But this movie ultimately is
                  made...because Jon Favreau knew more than the bloggers when it came to
                  casting Tony Stark. He went with Robert Downey Jr, and because of that,
                  Iron Man works... AND THEN SOME.</p>

                  <p><strong>An entertainining movie, especially for the pulsating action
                  sequences witty dialogue!</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>Frankly, I could never imagine Robert Downey Jr., playing a
                  superhero. This probably had to do with the initial impression I had
                  from what I had read so much about him - faltering years as a drug
                  addict jail bird in real life. I last saw him as the conniving Dr Kovak
                  in The Shaggy Dog, also as the rogue special agent, John Royce,
                  opposite the characters of Tommy Lee Jones Wesney Snipes in the
                  thriller action movie, US Marshalls, on cable television. With the last
                  movie, The Forbidden Kingdom, in the same movie theatre, my gym buddy I
                  saw a brief trailer of Iron Man, which had sort of piqued our personal
                  interest. Yesterday, my gym buddy decided to go for a movie in the late
                  afternoon, we chose Iron Man at Jurong Point. In a nut shell, Iron Man
                  was more of a CGI-boosted special effects extravaganza. I read from the
                  papers that the movie costed US165 million to make. The movie was based
                  on a superhero character from Marvel Comics, creators of Spiderman,
                  Fantastic Four X-men. Story-wise, it had a relatively simple plot.
                  Robert Downey Jr., played Tony Stark, a billionaire industrialist also
                  an inventor extraordinaire in designing building high tech weaponry of
                  mass destruction for the US Army. His company was known as Stark
                  Industries, founded by his late father, Howard Stark, who was involved
                  with the Manhattan Project. While traveling in Afghanistan on a
                  business trip, his convoy was ambushed in a war zone - he was injured,
                  ironically by a shrapnel from one of his own rockets - was kidnapped by
                  a group of militants, headed by a lunatic who wanted to control the
                  entire Middle East. Kept alive by a make-shift electro-magnet embedded
                  above his heart, apparently designed to prevent the shrapnel from
                  puncturing his heart, Tony was forced by his captors to build a missile
                  with metal scraps electronic leftovers in a cave-enclosed prison.
                  Instead our hero, with his usual cool arrogance drawing on his
                  inventive genius, hatched an escape plan revolving around a crude
                  metallic armoured suit -the advent of the prototype, Iron Man. Of
                  course, he managed to escape - with the electro-magnet over his heart
                  intact - eventually returned to America, seemingly a changed man after
                  seeing the death destruction caused by his companys weapons. With that,
                  he decided arbitrarily that Stark Industries would stop producing
                  military weapons, much to the chagrin of his mentor associate, Obadiah
                  Stane (played by Jeff Bridges), who somehow had other sneaky ideas of
                  his own. Meanwhile, Tony began experimenting with the electro-magnet
                  imbedded over his heart exchanging it with a miniaturised Arc Reactor -
                  apparently a power-yielding generator that could emit enough juice to
                  keep his heart shrapnel-free, at the same time, could provide adequate
                  power to a new armoured suit he had in mind. So, while our hero was
                  cranking his new armoured suit, Stane was secretly conniving with the
                  militants in Afghanistan, who apparently had managed to salvage the
                  original work plans of the armoured suit built in the cave during Tonys
                  captivity. It was during this movie segment that I realised that Tonys
                  unfortunate ambush in Afghanistan was all the while being set up by
                  Stane in a futile attempt to take over Stack Industries. With the
                  original work plans secured from Afghanistan, Stane managed to assemble
                  a team of specialists to build a modified version of the metallic
                  armoured suit, nicknamed Iron Monger. The remaining segment of the
                  movie - in fact, for all the excitement we were waiting for - displayed
                  the power struggle between Tony Stane, eventually culminating into a
                  violent clash - with CGI special effects, of course - between the two
                  heavy metal behemoths, Iron Man Iron Monger. We must accord our thanks
                  to the ingenuity inventiveness of the team from Stan Wilson Studios. If
                  you have the opportunity to watch the sci-fi action movie,
                  Transformers, you would quickly get a good idea of the resultant
                  rampant havoc, when two heavy metal behemoths danced, while humans
                  vehicles got caught beneath their fancy footwork. When compared with
                  Spiderman, Fantastic Four X-men, I had this notion that Iron Man was
                  more like a slapstick comedy to me. The two actresses, one playing
                  Tonys Girl Friday (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) the perky television
                  reporter, were primarily eye candies. I reckon they were there just to
                  show Tonys flamboyance. In fact, the most fascinating gadget in the
                  movie, to me at least, was the flash-drive-sized sonic paralysis
                  emitter, which Stane used to harmlessly knock out his opponents. I
                  would love to have one of that. Did I enjoy watching the movie at the
                  end? I sure did. Was it entertaining? Yes, especially the action
                  sequences witty dialogue. Was it worth spending the two hours in the
                  movie theatre? Yes. My gym buddy felt likewise. At least, I now have a
                  different impression about Robert Downey Jr.</p>

                  Downey Jr was great as Tony Stark Iron Man. The movie had a wonderful

                  Everhart Jon Favreau directed this movie and plays a small role and
                  Iron Man creator Stan Lee even has a cameo in the movie. Personally I
                  thought Gwyneth Paltrow was great in her role. The movie itself has a
                  great story, great back story and outstanding ending. The Spiderman
                  trilogy was good, Iron Man is on a whole other level! See this one!</p>
