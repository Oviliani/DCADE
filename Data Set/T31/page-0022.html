                  <p>The PRINCE OF PERSIA was an absolutely amazing love action story.
                  The part I loved the best, though, was the fact that it didnt leave
                  anything out. It didnt keep you guessing as to what wouldve happened
                  after the end of the movie (it tied up every last loose end). The
                  commercials didnt give away the actual movie too much, it was just
                  enough to let you know the main idea of the movie. The acting was
                  amazing and somewhat humorous at the same time. I give this movie
                  infinity thumbs up. I will definitely see this movie 20 more times.
                  More than worth your bucks!... One of the best movies I have ever
                  seen.</p>

                  <p>As usual the critics are clueless. Maybe it is because it is devoid

                  you want an entertaining action movie along the lines of The Mummy,
                  then its a great view. Would see it again.</p>

                  think that much of it at first but I was pleasantly surprised. The
                  players worked well together and they made the story line enjoyable. I
                  particularly liked the special effects which were innovative and
                  unexpected. The supporting cast was a treat as well throwing some nice
                  antics in the mix that brought it all together in the end. See it on
                  the big screen with family and friends you wont be disappointed,
                  enjoy.</p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>After watching Prince of Persia in theater i am of the opinion
                  thatthis is best movie based on a video game, but still cant overlook
                  thefact that it is far from perfect when it comes to good quality
                  cinema. Only 15-20 minutes into the movie i realized that the action
                  sequencesand the sword battles lack a certain amount of intensity and
                  bloodshed,and the director is more inclined to please the kids than the
                  grown upaudience. Also when one set fight and jump sequences end the
                  movieseems to rush to the next set of fight and jump sequence, with
                  shortdialogues and quirky humor in between. The action sequences
                  themselvesare not very long and although most have been well done, i
                  would havepreferred lesser but more elaborate ones than having too many
                  of them.Due to this the action sequences become a bit of drag towards
                  the endand the climax doesnt feel that strong. The acting of most
                  leadcharacters is amateurish leaving aside Jake and Alfred Molina who
                  fitsthe role of a crook merchant with a lighter side. Gemma Arteton on
                  theother hand stands out as most irritating as princess whatever
                  whocannot act and speaks with a heavy British accent in a movie with
                  anArabic setting. The method of storytelling does not leave any room
                  forcharacter development or growth of story. Dont get me wrong, the
                  storyof PoP is the strongest point of the movie and the only thing that
                  keptme interested. It is the way it has been told that leaves a lot to
                  bedesired, which actually is not a surprise to me as Mike Newell,
                  thedirector was also involved in Harry Potter and the goblet of fire,
                  theweakest movie in the franchise. Though it was refreshing to see a
                  videogame movie possessing a good story because attempts prior to this
                  hadno story to speak of, let alone a bad one. A serious take on the
                  good story and maybe no involvement of Disneywould certainly have
                  helped in making it a more mature movie than whatit is. Still give it
                  610 just for the story which otherwise is a pop cornentertainer.</p>

                  <p><strong>An Outstanding Movie!</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>The Prince of Persia was definattly not the movie I thought it was
                  going to be. I thought it would have a lot more magic and fantasy in
                  it. Not all war and things like that. Jake Gyllenhaal portrayed the
                  character of Prince Destan very well and made him stand out. The
                  effects were realistic and the story was interesting, but slightly
                  confusing. I would recommend this movie to people who are looking for a
                  good fight with just a touch of comedy.</p>

                  <p><strong>In my opinion, first good video game to movie
                  transition</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>I am a big video game nerd, so when a good game or game series get
                  madeinto a movie or movies, I get excited, and nervous. Turning a
                  videogame into a movie is a hard process, because so much of what makes
                  agood video game good, is the interaction between the storyline and
                  theuser control. Without a movie theater that lets us vote on what we
                  wantto happen or what we want the main character to do, the whole
                  thingloses that decision aspect. So it is hard to make a good video
                  movie. I have seen many other movies based off of video games. The
                  Super MarioBros movie... awful. The Bloodrayne series, and any other
                  movie done byUwe Boll is just terrible (he has turned a lot of video
                  games intomovies), Silent Hill was a decent movie, but compared to the
                  originalgame, it wasnt that respectable. The Resident Evil movies had
                  hardlyanything to do with the original games so I cant even compare
                  them.That is all I can think of off the top of my head. Other GOOD
                  directors such as Peter Jackson, want to try and tackle suchan idea,
                  specifically with Jackson, the Halo games. He and othersinvolved in
                  that project realized it would be too hard, too costly, andtoo
                  problematic to make such a highly rated game series into a movie,so it
                  got put an indefinite hold. So even good directors like PeterJackson
                  take their time with the idea. So going into this movie, I was
                  expecting to be disappointed. The Sandsof Time was one of my favorite
                  games for the gamecubePS2xbox console.When I was done with the movie, I
                  was throughly impressed. It wasntgroundbreaking in cinematography or
                  anything of the sort, but for thetype of movie director Jerry
                  Bruckheimer had to deal with, he did agreat job. The movie itself didnt
                  mirror the actual game, because if so, it wouldhave been a crazy movie,
                  but it did keep the major key elements thatwas in the original story.
                  There was even some homages paid in themovie, that normally wouldnt
                  have been smart film shots, butreferenced to the cinematic in the game.
                  It was small things like thatthat made me appreciate the movie more.
                  The movie had great action,thoughtful dialog and really interesting CG
                  that complemented the keystory concepts I mentioned earlier. The only
                  complaints I had were - There were some cheesy lines fromtime to time,
                  but I was kind of expecting that since it is a Disneymovie. - The fight
                  style of the game, of Dastan, was unique and is oneof the main reason
                  the game was so much fun to play. He was a fast,acrobatic fighting
                  machine. He would jump and flip off walls, slide,turn, dive off
                  anything and everything in the game, making theobstacles an interesting
                  play through. In the movie, they do have somescenes where he has to
                  show those skills, but it is only for a shorttime. He does do a good
                  amount of fighting, but less of the acrobatics.I really wish they did a
                  little more of that in the movie. Besides that, I thought it was a
                  great movie, and anyone else thatlikes a good action movie, or anyone
                  that was a big fan of the gamesshould go see it!</p>

                  <p><strong>Actually Pretty Damn Good, flawed but much better than the
                  critics reviews</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>This movie was much better than the poor reviews it got, and
                  actuallybetter than I hoped, and Im no softy when it comes to reviewing
                  moviesbut I think both this and Robin Hood got a bad rap by the
                  critics, bothmovies while flawed were still quite enjoyable. I think
                  this movie fellvictim to a bad ad campaign that actually made the movie
                  seem LESSinteresting than it really is. Gemma Arterton shines in this,
                  her mostverbose role to date, and Gylenhaal is actually pretty damn
                  good aswell, though outdone by his co-star, and Alfred Molina puts in a
                  greatperformance as comic relief for the movie. I think the
                  mostridiculous part of the whole movie is the damn British accents
                  (WHY!???). To compare it to Bruckheimers other famous franchise I
                  wouldsay it is faaar better than Pirates 3, slightly better than
                  Pirates2 and not as good as the original Pirates, that should give you
                  agood idea of what to expect.</p>

                  but i have seen better in 2000. The story was hard to understand and
                  not very clever. Some video games do well on the big screen but his is
                  not one of them. I almost fell asleep a few times. I can see why it
                  will do well because it has elements of summer blockbuster but will i
                  call it a great movie NO!!! I am all for simple entertainment but i was

                  that thire would be a 2nd movie. The one thing that I didnt like is the
                  ending but other then that, I would buy the movie on Blu-ray when is
                  release in stores. If you want to understand Prince of Persia, then you
                  should check out the game.</p>

                  <p><strong>Another bad video game film (but better than
                  most)</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>Preface The new adventure film Prince of Persia The Sands of Time
                  isbased on a video game of the same name that was released in 2003
                  forall major platforms. The game is cited as one of the best
                  titlesavailable on multiple counsels (of its time). The title Prince,
                  themost famous middle easterner in video gaming was first introduced
                  in1989 as a PC oriented take on platforming gameplay made popular
                  bySuper Mario Bros. a few years earlier. The franchise lay dormant
                  forseveral years later after a failed foray into 3D on Sega Dreamcast
                  andwas reintroduced with the Sands of Time trilogy. Im saddened to
                  write another film review discouraging people fromseeing a film based
                  on a video game. This may be the best of the lot,occurring nearly
                  twenty years after the genre was introduced by thefilm adaptation of
                  Super Mario Brothers in 1993. And like many of itscousins, the movie
                  pushes credulity (even for its video game origins)too the point of
                  absurdity. The main attraction of the game was turnedinto a deus ex
                  machina contrivance in an effort to attain blockbusterclichs. The film
                  version of Sands of Time effectively ignores thefirst games placement
                  in a series and throws elements of all threegames together in one lumpy
                  mess. Its been edited (expanded) tonothing more than the Prince saving
                  Persia from his traitorous uncle. Nothing has time to unfold as either
                  moviegoers or fans of the gamewould like. Those who have not played the
                  game will not like how theyare bludgeoned with well-executed but
                  relentless action sequences. Someof these are done in real time without
                  the addition of too many digitaleffects. They are the most memorable
                  parts, and youll know which theyare. Video game players controlled the
                  Prince through a variety ofobstacles as they guided him to an
                  objective. Completing the game didnot require all enemies to be
                  defeated, and it was sometimes favorableto leave them be. The film
                  Prince is as cunning as any video gameplayer but too rash. Our hero was
                  determined and fearless yet shrewd.He would disapprove of his
                  representation here. I did enjoy how the films fights were staged, even
                  the hallucinogenicCGI ones. The platforming element of the game was
                  replicated very well.We see the prince run along walls, jump from place
                  to place, and usehis dagger to reverse the flow of time (see title).
                  Admittedly, thedagger is the worse part of the movie. It grants its
                  holder temporarytime travel, and the screenwriters failed to translate
                  it properly intothe story. There are two narrative purposes to it that
                  are laughablybad. The film ends with the dagger being corrupted and
                  magicallysending the Prince back to the beginning of the movie where
                  heapprehends his uncle and experiences the mandatory happy ending.
                  Thisis the kind of comedic retailing of a story I would expect out of
                  ayoutube or newgrounds parody. I got another chuckle when I read
                  onWikipedia that the film was delayed due to the 2008 writers strike. I
                  was hoping this would finally be the one game-to-film adaptation Icould
                  freely recommend to anyone. Its another failure, and I now thinkthe
                  great game film will be a low budget adaptation of a
                  non-mainstreamgame. I can see a film noir being made of Hotel Dusk Room
                  315. Filmstudios, I beseech you, buy the movie rights to a recently
                  releasedwell-received game that didnt sell very well. Let someone be
                  forced tocraft a satisfying film out of it and release it in few
                  locations. 30th of 2010 Not Recommended )</p>
