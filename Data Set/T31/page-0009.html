                  <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p>

                  <p>Release the Kraken! Ah, it could only be Clash of the Titans, the
                  2010 remake that retains the instruction to unleash the great beastie
                  from the sea. The 1981 original boasted Ray Harryhausens legendary
                  stop-motion technique of animating various mythological creatures--it
                  was his final feature project--and given the cornball approach of the
                  movie in general, that was the main draw. The remake supplies new
                  state-of-the-art special effects (released in 3-D) and a nicely
                  muscular sense of momentum. Sam Worthington (the Avatar guy) plays
                  Perseus, a demigod who doesnt know that Zeus (Liam Neeson) is his
                  father. Perseus is selected to lead an expedition to find and slay the
                  Medusa, lest Zeuss evil brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes, in fine slinking
                  mode) rain down misery upon a seaport--and you just know that means the
                  Kraken is coming. Ye gods, its a mess, and we havent even mentioned the
                  witches and the harpies and the giant scorpions. But if we did, it
                  would be clear that Clash of the Titans is a perfectly dandy popcorn
                  epic, unpretentious and punchy. Director Louis Leterrier (Transporter
                  2) gets a fine rhythm going during Perseuss trek, and you can even
                  forgive the hokey shafts-of-light-through-clouds look of Olympus.
                  Leterrier also had the good sense to import the marvelous Danish star
                  Mads Mikkelsen to provide mentoring duties to Perseus Gemma Arterton
                  and Alexa Davalos fulfill the eye-candy roles. Its up to individual
                  viewers to choose which they prefer--Harryhausens magically
                  hand-wrought creations (his Medusa sequence is an absolute killer) or
                  the 21st centurys slick computer-generated variations. But nostalgia
                  aside, it would be hard to deny that this is one case where the remake
                  tops the original.</p>

                  <p><strong>Fun adventure movie</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>Demi-god Perseus (Sam Worthington), the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson)
                  and a human mother, undertakes a quest to save the city of Argos from
                  the wrath of the Kraken, an enormous sea monster that the gods plan to
                  release as punishment for defiance. Director Louis Leterrier keeps the
                  pace snappy and handles CGI creatures well, as he demonstrated with The
                  Incredible Hulk. Some reviewers want more story, but it seems to me
                  that the figures of Greek myth are generally at the mercy of fate and
                  destiny, so I didnt miss the lack of motivations rooted deeply in
                  character. I also didnt mind the scrambling of mythology, although I
                  wouldnt recommend this movie as a source for college students trying to
                  crank out a term paper on Greek myths at the last minute. I didnt even
                  mind Perseuss buzzcut in a world where everyone else (even some of the
                  women) have beards and long hair. At least its easy to pick him out of
                  a crowd. The giant scorpions, the Medusa, the harpies, and the Kraken
                  all looked great and the action was exciting enough to keep me happily
                  shoveling popcorn into my mouth. BTW, I elected to see the film in 2D
                  since I had read some bad reviews of the murky look of the film after
                  the last minute decision to switch it to 3D. Avatar demonstrated that
                  3D technology has finally arrived and is worth the extra bucks when
                  done right. However, too many Hollywood productions trying to jump onto
                  the bandwagon with substandard product may make moviegoers think twice
                  about paying higher ticket prices.</p>

                  <p><strong>awesome remake</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>Two things of why I think this movie is cool. great CGI and
                  greataction scenes even though it was quick. Heres the plot from
                  Wikipedia.The film begins with a narration by Io, explaining that there
                  wereoriginally three Gods Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. The Gods
                  defeatedtheir greatest enemies, the Titans, with the help of Hadess
                  creation,the Kraken. After the Titans defeat, Zeus created humans and
                  ruledthem while Poseidon ruled the sea, but Hades, having been deceived
                  byhis brother Zeus was forced to rule the Underworld, constantly
                  plottingto take Zeuss throne for himself.A fisherman, Spyros, finds a
                  coffin adrift in the sea, discovering ababy, Perseus, and his dead
                  mother, Dana, inside. Spyros decides toraise Perseus as his own. Years
                  later, Perseus and his family arefishing when they witness a group of
                  soldiers from Argos destroying astatue of Zeus and declaring war
                  against the Gods. Hades appears andcommands harpies to massacre the
                  soldiers. The harpies then destroyPerseuss familys fishing boat.
                  Perseus tries to save his family butto no avail, the surviving soldiers
                  take Perseus back to Argos.During a feast for the returning soldiers
                  King Cepheus and QueenCassiopeia of Argos compare themselves and their
                  daughter, Andromeda,to the Gods. Andromeda is against fighting the
                  Gods, and is protestingwhen Hades appears and kills the remaining
                  soldiers. Perseus isunaffected however, and Hades realizes Perseus is a
                  demigod and revealsZeus is Perseuss father. Hades kills the queen, and
                  threatens that ifPrincess Andromeda is not sacrificed to the Kraken,
                  Argos will bedestroyed in 10 days.The king seeks the help of Perseus.
                  Perseus initially refuses, butdecides to help when he meets Io, a woman
                  who does not age aspunishment for refusing to be seduced by a God. Io
                  has watched overPerseus from the time he was born, and assures him he
                  can have hisrevenge against Hades if he helps Argos in its time of
                  need. Perseusand Io embark on a quest to find the Stygian Witches.
                  Hades enlistsAcrisius, the former king of Argos who was married to Dana
                  when Zeusimpregnated her with Perseus. Acrisius was leading men to
                  attackOlympus, and while other gods wanted to annihilate Acrisius,
                  Zeuswanted to make an example of him. He Snuck into Danas bed in the
                  formof Acrisius and impregnated her. Acrisius declared that the baby
                  couldnot be born, and set Dana and the baby Perseus adrift in their
                  coffinfor this act, Zeus struck Acrisius with lightning, leaving
                  himhideously disfigured. Hades imbues him with powers to aid him
                  inkilling Perseus, and Acrisius takes the name of Calibos. While in
                  thewoods, Perseus and his men discover a sword forged in Olympus that
                  willonly display power if it is wielded by Perseus. Perseus also
                  discoversa winged horse called Pegasus. Perseus refuses to use either
                  of thesegifts, as he does not wish to be a God. Calibos attacks the
                  group ledby Perseus. They severe the hand of Calibos, but Calibos blood
                  formsgiant scorpions from the sand, and Perseus and his group are
                  attacked.Though they slay several scorpions, most of the group are
                  slain, andthe survivors surrounded by more of the monsters. They are
                  saved by theDjinn, sand-demons with magical powers who tame the
                  scorpions. Perseusand the Djinn agree to cooperate, since the Djinn
                  wish to see the Godsdefeated.At the Garden of Stygia, the Stygian
                  Witches tell Perseus that the headof Medusa could kill the Kraken, but
                  that Perseus will die in theprocess. After leaving the witches, Perseus
                  is visited by Zeus whooffers him asylum on Mount Olympus. He refuses.
                  Zeus gives him insteada golden drachma. Perseus uses the coin to bribe
                  Charon for passageinto the Underworld and enters Medusas lair. Although
                  four of Perseusremaining soldiers fight hard to stay alive, one by one
                  they are turnedto stone by her gaze. Draco, one of the soldiers with
                  Perseus, allowshimself to be turned to stone to give Perseus a clear
                  shot at Medusashead. Perseus kills Medusa, but Calibos returns and
                  kills Io. Perseusengages Calibos in combat and kills him, using the
                  sword from Olympusto stab him in the heart and turn him back into
                  Acrisius in human form.With his final breaths, Acrisius tells Perseus
                  to never become a God.Perseus rides Pegasus back to Argos with Medusas
                  head to find thecitizens of Argos planning to sacrifice Andromeda to
                  the Kraken, whohas been summoned by Hades. Hades reveals to Zeus the
                  destruction ofArgos will give him enough power to overthrow the other
                  Olympians. Zeusattempts to banish Hades back to the Underworld, but
                  Hades overpowershim. Zeus then reveals to Hades that Perseus is still
                  alive and is inArgos. Hades leaves to oversee the Krakens attack and
                  ensure hisvictory.Perseus returns to Argos, but Hades sends harpies to
                  kill him. Perseusdefeats the creatures sent by Hades and uses the head
                  of Medusa to turnthe Kraken into stone. Hades arrives just in time to
                  see his creationdie. Perseus draws his sword, but Hades reminds him
                  that he is a God,and therefore cannot be killed. Perseus replies that
                  though Hades canlive forever, it will not be in the world of men and
                  throws his swordat Hades, charged with a bolt of lightning from Zeus
                  that banishesHades to the Underworld. After saving Argos from
                  destruction, Andromedasuggests that Perseus become king and rule Argos
                  at her side, but hedeclines.Zeus appears before Perseus again and
                  offers to make him a God, but herefuses. Zeus warns Perseus that Hades
                  will return to rule the world indarkness when mankind is fearful. Since
                  Perseus is intent to stay onEarth, Zeus resurrects Io, and the two
                  embrace while Pegasus fliesabove them.</p>

                  <p>I saw the Clash of the Titans remake over the weekend, and it was
                  entertaining. It wasnt great, bit it wasnt bad either. Its sorta in the
                  middle. The special effects is definitely better than the original. I
                  also liked the cinematography as well as the fight scenes. I also liked
                  the character of Perseus had been broaden about his feelings about not
                  wanting to be a god.I dont see any use of the 3D glasses with the
                  exception with the battle against the Kraken at the end.It was a fun
                  film to watch and worthy of a matinee price.I give it 3 stars out of
                  five.</p>

                  close to AVITAR. The action at most is amusing at times. The only good

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>Ray Harryhausens brand of fantasy was very much to my
                  taste.Harryhausen was cutting edge at the time, but the cutting edge
                  hasmoved on and I have long wondered what would be the results
                  ifHarryhausens films were to be revisited using state of the art
                  CGI.Now we have the answer.This film, though quite clearly based on
                  Harryhausens original, playsfast and loose with some elements of it
                  but, since the original playedfast and loose with myth (both versions
                  feature the Kraken, from Norsemyth, for instance) I dont suppose one
                  can complain too much.There are things to like and things to regard as
                  less than wonderful.Things to like - the effects, for a starter. They
                  are excellent.Mythological monsters have never looked so real. They
                  have followedHarryhausens design for Medusa, but improved her by way of
                  her havinga beautiful face. I would have welcomed her having some
                  dialogue. RalphFiennes is a splendidly villainous Hades, Alexa Davalos
                  works wonderswith a dismayingly underwritten Andromeda, and Gemma
                  Artertoneffortlessly walks away with every scene she is in. Im glad the
                  comedyowl from the original puts in an appearance, but Im even more
                  gladthat it is no more than a 10 second cameo.On to the less positive
                  aspects. The 3D adds nothing (as a major 3Dfan, it saddens me to say
                  this - see How To Train Your Dragon in 3D,and this one flat). The
                  constantly moving camera during actionsequences (Bourne syndrome) is
                  dreadfully distracting. The story ismostly fine, although it loses
                  something by having Perseus questdriven by anger rather than the need
                  to save Andromeda - a bit ofromance would have been welcome. The script
                  is no more thanserviceable. Most of the characters are pure cardboard,
                  and SamWorthington brings no more to Perseus than Harry Hamlin
                  did.Incidentally, I have noted people commenting that Sam
                  Worthingtonsaccent slips from time to time and his natural Aussie shows
                  through,but I dont think hes actually doing an accent - I think he is
                  aunaturel throughout.If I am honest, the original Clash Of The Titans
                  was essentially aninsubstantial romp with great monsters this remake is
                  pretty much thesame.</p>

                  <p><strong>OK, But Not Great</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>Before I start this review, I must say that I hate action
                  movies.Sorry, correction I despise action movies. The fight scenes are
                  alwaysdragged out and takes up the majority of the movie. I wasnt
                  initiallypleased to be dragged to see this movie, but it wasnt as bad
                  as Ithought it was going to be. The movie itself was shorter than
                  theaverage Hollywood blockbuster, at roughly 107 minutes long. The
                  actionscenes werent as long as Id thought them to be and in fact were
                  veryshort. I was happy with this but some hardcore action fans may find
                  aproblem with this. So why am I only giving this a 510? The reason
                  forthat is because the acting is very wooden here. Sam Worthington
                  willhardly score an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Perseus and
                  LiamNeesons Zeus leaves much to be desired ( although his wife did
                  diebefore filming this movie, so it must have been hard on him ).
                  Thescript was also weak here too, with not a lot of characters
                  gettingmuch dialogue. By the way, before I finish up here, I noticed
                  somethinginteresting I noticed that there was a hint of atheism during
                  some ofthe scenes in Argos. I dont know was it intended but I thought
                  itactually made the movie a bit more interesting. In conclusion its
                  anOK movie to watch for passing time, but not if you want high
                  qualityacting.</p>

                  <p>I dont know what people are complaining about. After watching the

                  begin with. I will admit though, that it was great for the time. But I
                  was falling asleep, graphics were horrible, and the cheese factor was
                  off the charts. Then, after reading all these complaints I wasnt
                  expecting much and came out saying Wow! I really liked it. The visuals
                  were pretty awesome, especially the Kracken scene. I will admit there
                  were some cheesy parts but there were even some scenes that made me
                  laugh out loud which was totally unexpected, but loved it! I would
                  definitely recommend this film.</p>

                  <p>Dare I say it....this movie should have been 30 minutes longer. Then
                  maybe people wouldnt pop in and out like bunny rabbits and there would
                  have been some general flow to the film. 3D NOOOOO! There were more 3D
                  effects in the previews for the OWL film then in the entire Clash of
                  the Titans film, that was terrible and the other 3 people with me felt
                  like they were cheated and scammed. There were several random lines
                  that made no sense and were completely out of character. Then there was
                  the terrible love story, if you can call a creeper following you around
                  your whole life a love story.By the end I wished I was on Pegasus (The
                  randomly appearing flying horse) in order to get out of the theater as
                  fast as possible.</p>
