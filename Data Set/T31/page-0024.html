                  <p>OK to enjoy this movie you need to turn off your brain and just
                  well, sit back and enjoy it. This is a riotous, hyper-violent movie
                  where the bad guys dont just lose, they get their butts kicked. The
                  characters are lame but then again that is the point. The downside is
                  that the characters are two-dimensional and almost lame they are so
                  pure and righteous. The acting is dreadful and the script is just so
                  lame that the good story telling is dragged down by the need to drop an
                  F-Bomb every other word. I mean that this script seems to be written by
                  14 year old boys who think it is cool to swear. While that drags down
                  the script, the performances do rescue it. All in all this is a fun
                  movie. Watch it, but like I said, turn your brain off to enjoy!</p>

                  <p><strong>Visceral, violent and could be alarmingly disturbing, but
                  still what fun!</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>Uma Thurmans The Bride would certainly show Kick Ass to her
                  daughter, in time to prepare both themselves for Tarantinos Volume
                  Three. Kick Ass is a bloody, violent action extravaganza that is smart
                  enough to find its own footing, without being bogged down by
                  censorship, and audience expectations. The highlight of the film is Hit
                  Girl, who singlehandedly steals the spotlight from all her adult
                  counterparts, including Kick Ass himself. This element of
                  deconstruction, about how an 11-year-old girl could kill, maim, often
                  bloody, with abandonment, and even with relish, is effective, for the
                  most part. However, one of the main reasons why the film did not sit
                  well with other people is in regards to the ethical implications of the
                  character of Hit Girl, whom all fantasies, both carnal and violent, Im
                  sure, have been projected onto her on the big screen. However, though
                  the deconstruction of the representation of superheroes and also our
                  myriad of expectations coming from the typical way they are drawn is
                  merely effective for the most part in this film, the lack of dramatic
                  and emotional substantiality is what weakens the film, in regards to
                  where it stands on ethics and morality. It does not matter if there is
                  a lack of ethics and morality in the film, it is after all, a
                  deconstruction, a satire, an overturning of the comic book and super
                  hero genre. However, it seems to gloss it over at the end. Yes, this is
                  a film about superheroes, but it does not mean that it could just skim
                  over the emotional and dramatic nature even flawed superheroes are just
                  as humans as the viewers who root for them. Hit Girl appears to be
                  merely shaken, not traumatized by the end. Sure, she has been
                  efficiently trained to be like that however, she is still a child. Even
                  Batman in The Dark Knight had been given a chance to contemplate, Hit
                  Girl has only been given a scene with her staring down at melted
                  marshmallows floating in hot chocolate getting cold, a scene that does
                  humanize her, but not enough. Having said that, Kick Ass is a great
                  film, but it can only be truly appreciated by those who are able to
                  understand it enough within a contextual postmodern realm, others will
                  shrug it off as immoral and pointless.</p>

                  <p>Let me start by saying Do not believe the hype! It is not a bad
                  movie,but definitely not an 8.5 movie and I hope I can explain my
                  concerns. First This movie has not a consistent way of storytelling.
                  You haveparts that look like a teenage comedy and two minutes later the
                  musicchanges and the look of the movie changes and suddenly you have a
                  darkand heavy atmosphere. This change did not look artistic to me.
                  Itrather looked, like someone messed up different genres because he
                  hadno idea what this movie should look like. Teenagers are not allowed
                  inthis film and most adults will be bored by the teenage life of the
                  leadactor. It is neither fish nor meat, it is inconsistent. Second To
                  me the development of the characters was messed up too. Ittook 35
                  minutes to describe kick ass (although you knew after 5 minuteswhat
                  this character is supposed to be), but it took only two minutes
                  todescribe hitgirl. Third The soundtrack is a reason why this movie is
                  so messed up. Insome scenes you had a real film score (when big daddy
                  killed the peoplein the warehouse), that created an intense atmosphere,
                  in other scenesyou had some party music that was just inappropriate.
                  Hitgirl justlost her father and two minutes later we have partytime
                  again? To methe soundtrack did not help to make it a good movie. Fourth
                  I love violent movies. I loved 300, I loved inglorious basterdsand so
                  on. I am not a wuss. A well done killing of evil gangsters isalways
                  welcome. But in this movie the violence did not help the movieto become
                  something solid. Why putting the guy in the microwave? Forwhat reason?
                  Just to see him explode? Why killing the guy in the carcompactor? Just
                  for seeing him explode too? The big problem is againthe inconsistence
                  of the entire movie. If it would have been just acomedy, than fine.
                  Would it have been just a dark movie like Darkknight, than fine. But
                  this strange clutter of genres destroys it andleaves the viewer
                  helpless. Should I laugh, because the other peopleare laughing,
                  although the scene is not funny? Should I feel somethingdeep when big
                  daddy dies? In some moments I thought, that I feltemotionaly raped in
                  some strange way. Someone forces me to laughabout something that is
                  just not appropriate to laugh about. I could write much more (script,
                  acting, cut...), but the result isThis movie does not know what it
                  should be. The movie was OK, but mylife would be a little bit better
                  without having seen it.</p>

                  huge Iron Man fan, but it is going to take a-lot to beat this. Overall

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>In a movie industry cluttered with own-grown hype, gimmicks and lack
                  ofidea, Kick Ass bursts onto the screen and shatters all expectationsin
                  its wake. Youre on this page because you think its gonna be good?Wrong.
                  Or youre here because you think it looks a decent or a goodsuperhero
                  movie to join the ranks of the ones you already love? DEADwrong. Reason
                  being, is Kick Assdozent want to be good or aboveaverage, Kick Ass
                  wants to be great and it has the balls to want tobe original too.
                  Seemingly impossible in a done to death genre whereweve already
                  glimpsed Mark Millars signature style in Wanted, butKick Ass is all
                  about the unexpected. Make no mistake, nothing you believe of this
                  movie compares to whatVaughn and co. serve up for you. Mainly because
                  everyone involved seemsdetermined to Honor the comic and redefine a
                  genre. Most moviesentertain, but this one? It wants to BLOW YOU AWAY!
                  Less smarter movieshave done that but Kick Ass aint giving that up
                  either. Its scriptis razor-sharp, dumping the pretension of the burden
                  of heroismcrippling even the better superhero films, showing this in
                  actionsrather than long drawn out emoting. Matthew Vaughn has finally
                  solvedthe hurdle that all superhero movies suffer, namely how to get to
                  knowand love your characters without long drawn out scenes. He does it
                  bykeeping them moving. The more they do, the more they try, the more
                  youknow and love them. And make the narrative interesting and most of
                  allratable so were with Dave 100 of the way, it dozent just have
                  tofunctional. The real visual joy of Kick Ass is its desire to keep it
                  simple butnot at the expense of wowing us. Make characters do cool
                  things,instead of Michael Bay-esquire things happening to them. Thats
                  whythey exude coolness, despite Daves almost humdrum existence. This
                  isthe everyman doing the things we could do if wanted to not a guy
                  fromanother reality or possessed with great drive and ambition. Dave
                  wantsto get laid. He wants to be hip. Even your bad guy in this
                  isbelievable. Watching the whirlwind that is Hit Girl perform a
                  routinealmost straight out of Jackie Chans Hong Kong days stuns us in a
                  wayno big screen chase ever could. Visually the film takes all the
                  thingwe DID love from the movies that ultimately didnt zing and churns
                  theminto a finely balanced flawless brew. Did I mention its feel good?
                  From its inspired use of music (againutterly ratable) right down to its
                  outstanding score, like GetCarter for superheroes I could say more but
                  theres surprises instore. In a movie this stunning, acting is usually
                  secondary (as any JamesCameron film shows). Not a bit of it. In a cast
                  as eclectic as thestyles the film embraces you have performances that
                  set a benchmark forall concerned. Can Mark Strong already better his
                  stellar work? See hismenacing and humorous turn as DAmico, a career
                  best. Christopher MintzPlasse follows Role Models by breaking out of
                  McLovin mode. His guyhas layers and he can show them. Nicolas Cage as
                  expected returns tohis past glories playing larger than life eccentric
                  characters but notwithout a little sadness too. Joining him is Chloe
                  Moretz foreverdestined to be remembered for her first major role. She
                  idolizedAngelina Jolie apparently. Guess what, you trounced any action
                  movieshe has ever made! Moretz dominates any scenes shes in, no easy
                  taskconsidering her fellow cast! Aaron Johnson has the most difficult
                  jobof all. Being an original umber-geek after Michael Cera set
                  thestandard (anyone whos seen Zombieland knows its hard to write
                  anoriginal geek even in a great movie). He shakes it, redefines it
                  andOWNS it. He leads the movie like he wrote it, joined by a cast
                  whereeven the smallest roles are fully fleshed out. Its quite an
                  ensemble.A renegade band of acting styles forming a perfect one
                  andcomplementing the films fun style. Watching Kick Ass is ultimately
                  like being on a thrill-ride, itdozent just want to dazzle you, its
                  wants to draw you in, ride thewave and leave the cinema on a high. And
                  it dozent do that withgimmicks or tried and tested formulas, it breaks
                  the mold, shakesconventions and wants you to be surprised while
                  complementing all themovies you already love. Its not just a movie, its
                  a standard, onethat promises to prove movies like this can be written
                  with great heartand brain.</p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>I had my doubts about Kick-Ass after seeing the trailers. It
                  seemedlike just another typical teenagersex comedy. Yes, the movie
                  doescontain humor that could fit in to that category, but this movie
                  wasmore than that. Kick-Ass starts with a very comedic tone and
                  suddenlyfades in to an in-your-face action film which..kicks ass. First
                  off,this movie is NOT a child-friendly film. It contains extremely
                  graphicviolence mostly involving the 11 year old, Hit-Girl. The
                  storyline ofthis movie grabs you from the beginning. It follows a story
                  of revengeinvolving Big Daddy and Hit-Girl. This movie is very funny
                  but overall,a solid action film. This kills are crazy, the tone is just
                  sohardcore, and the laughs keep coming throughout the whole film.
                  Thismovie is a must-see for anyone who enjoys action, comedy, and
                  drama.Overall fantastic movie.</p>

                  <p>This film is quite literally Kick-Ass. One of the few fresh
                  feelingcomedies around nowadays. The story is believable, the casting
                  issuperb and action scenes dont feel rushed and flow along with
                  thefilm. For anyone who was expecting to see a slightly
                  humorousself-indulgent comic flick this will blow you away. Ill be
                  honest inthat some elements of the story seemed like cheats, especially
                  theending shot. But these short-cuts are totally acceptable for
                  thebrilliant moments of genius comedy that flood the movie. Id also
                  liketo say that Nic Cage is tremendous as Big daddy, showing his
                  truediversity as an actor once again. To sum up this film.....Im sorry

                  <p>Not having read the graphic novel upon which its based, I had
                  noexpectations waking into Kick-Ass. The basic concept of a young
                  mandressing up to act like a superhero wasnt that far out there,
                  butoutside of it would be so super cool if there was nothing in the
                  filmthat spoke to why this kid wanted was willing to get himself killed
                  ina stupid outfit. I love super hero movies (the Dark Knight being
                  myfavorite movie in years) and yet I dont know how many I found
                  myselfsaying this is too stupid to believe throughout the film. In
                  otherwords, the writing was weak, at times so weak that I found
                  myselfcringing at the hackneyed, shallow and two dimensional dialogue,
                  andmystified by the inconsistent behavior of the characters (eg. Red
                  Mistcold bloodedly kills Hit Girl, and then is sooooo upset that
                  Kick-Assis being abused ... just plain stupid). While the actions
                  sequenceswere well choreographed and the acting of Nick Cage and Chloe
                  Moretzkept it interesting, the mind numbing predictability of the
                  storytelling was simply fatal. If youre 12, love comics and have no

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>Now being a fan of Matthew Vaughns last two films, Kick-Ass
                  clearlyseemed like his most controversial outing to date, without
                  evencomparing it to his other work. Both Layer Cake and Stardust
                  boththough enjoyable and well received felt like discrete nods to
                  thedistributors that this man can do a fine job of directing no
                  matterwhat the genre and that he deserves the room for development,
                  sinceshowing he is capable of great potential. Then came along
                  Kick-Ass, which easily is one of this years must sees,simply because it
                  is nothing and everything like you expect. ExampleExpect the costumes
                  to look out of place, expect the C-word bomb froman 11 year old girl
                  and expect a finale that almost makes the end ofKill Bill Volume 1 look
                  like a fairytale. However what wasnt expectedwas the hilarious
                  conversations between Big Daddy (Nic Cage as aEarless Batman) and his
                  daughter Hit Girl (The awe inspiring ChloeMoretz) and the vast amount
                  of violence, dark humour and the way itwalks all over society like
                  another blood splattered corpse ofsatisfaction. Dave Livewski (Aaron
                  Johnson) struggles to understand why there is noactive costumed
                  vigilantes around in New York to stop crime, andthrough his comic
                  inspired heroism decides to become Kick-Ass (The herothis time, not the
                  film title). So with his cheesy green wetsuit,determination and lack of
                  social life, Daves roller-coaster begins.His near fatal experiences
                  doesnt hinder his growing reputation orsuperhero buddies including Red
                  Mist (Superbads ChristopherMintz-Plasse) and the infamous
                  father-daughter duo to bringingblood-blitzed peace to a crime-ridden
                  city. Kick-Ass is a guilty pleasure that people shouldnt be ashamed to
                  enjoyon the basis of the blaspheming and gore infested mass killings.
                  Thereis a huge amount of likability for the leads who have all done
                  justiceto make the most of their characters capabilities Chloe
                  Moretzdeserves particular credit to her notorious role by putting the
                  Gonnablow your brains out in well, just that. Matthew Vaughn has
                  clearlyestablished himself as a man of many talents and after this its
                  nothard to see why, there is certainly room for a sequel on the
                  horizon,thats for sure.</p>

                  the horror andmost of the magic from Neil Gaimans and Charles Vess
                  magicalfairy-tale and turn it into an anodyne, emasculated chase-movie.
                  Forget that. They have redeemed themselves in mine eye (although

                  self-aware play on the mythos ofsuperhero movies that takes itself JUST
                  seriously enough in the actionscenes whilst at the same time making
                  them so OTT that Shoot em Uplooks like a Dogme film. Mintz-Plasse has
                  kicked off his McLovin boots in a role that looksvery promising for a
                  sequel, and at LAST Nic Cage is playing a rolethat doesnt require him
                  to boost the share price of Grecian 2000 (Nic.What the HELL were you
                  doing in Ghost Rider? Why, man? WHY?) And AaronJohnson is the everykid
                  that we were between the ages of 10 and 17.Nerdy. Unnoticed. Not even
                  outstanding amongst his non-outstandingfriends. All he wants is to stop
                  the small-time thugs from stealing hisphone please. He has no skill, no
                  training, and no clue. But what hedoes have is an overwhelming belief
                  that he CAN make a difference, inthe face of all reality. Indeed, its
                  this that carries him through.Powered by his own unshakeable certainty,
                  the small time crooks hebattles are beaten mainly by his absolute
                  refusal to lie down when theyhit him. But its Chloe Moretz who is the
                  real stand-out here. Shes going to beremembered for this, her first
                  major role, for a long time. As theinsanely violent Hit-Girl, she
                  treads a delicate line between sweetinnocence and foul-mouthed
                  brutality that promises a great career aheadof her. A totally
                  convincing performance that makes it completelyunderstandable for a 13
                  year old to get all gushy because shes got anew matching pair of
                  butterfly knives for her birthday. By the time the film reached its
                  climax I was laughing, cheering andclapping like a fanboy at his first
                  Star Trek convention. Like I said. GO AND SEE THIS FILM! Hypnotoad
                  Commands It!! but hell always be McLovin to me.</p>
