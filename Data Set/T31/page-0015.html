                  <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p>

                  <p>Oscar winner Russell Crowe stars as the legendary figure known by
                  generations as Robin Hood, whose exploits have endured in popular
                  mythology and ignited the imagination of those who share his spirit of
                  adventure and righteousness. In 13th century England, Robin and his
                  band of marauders confront corruption in a local village and lead an
                  uprising against the crown that will forever alter the balance of world
                  power. And whether thief or hero, one man from humble beginnings will
                  become an eternal symbol of freedom for his people. Robin Hood
                  chronicles the life of an expert archer, previously interested only in
                  self-preservation, from his service in King Richards army against the
                  French. Upon Richards death, Robin travels to Nottingham, a town
                  suffering from the corruption of a despotic sheriff and crippling
                  taxation, where he falls for the spirited widow Lady Marian (Oscar
                  winner Cate Blanchett), a woman skeptical of the identity and
                  motivations of this crusader from the forest. Hoping to earn the hand
                  of Maid Marian and salvage the village, Robin assembles a gang whose
                  lethal mercenary skills are matched only by its appetite for life.
                  Together, they begin preying on the indulgent upper class to correct
                  injustices under the sheriff. With their country weakened from decades
                  of war, embattled from the ineffective rule of the new king and
                  vulnerable to insurgencies from within and threats from afar, Robin and
                  his men heed a call to ever greater adventure. This unlikeliest of
                  heroes and his allies set off to protect their country from slipping
                  into bloody civil war and return glory to England once more. HD 720p

                  <p>Most of the critics hated this movie. A lot of audiences hated this
                  movie. I have no idea why. The combination of Russell Crowe and Cate
                  Blanchett could make paint drying fascinating. There is not a poor
                  acting job in this film, the script was solid, the story was compelling
                  and it was directed well. Seriously, what more do you want?? Go into
                  the movie with a willing suspension of disbelief and dont compare it
                  with any movie youve seen before about Robin Hood because thats not
                  what this movie is and you will enjoy it. I think we have all just seen
                  to many movies that we forget how to enjoy the ones with merit without
                  being groundbreaking. Ridley Scotts vision for Robin Hood is
                  well-executed, well-acted, and well-directed. Enjoy it while knowing
                  its not going to change your life.</p>

                  <p><strong>Robin Longstride Striding Long Indeed +++</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>I like many aspects of this refreshingly earthy gritty variant of
                  the various Robin Hood sagas. The motion and emotion are entrancing --
                  with some good humor to balance the many grim era-settings -- such as
                  the Norman French landing-craft coming FROM Normandy for the last
                  battle -- much like the ones that went TO there more recently WW II.
                  The settings are very historically realistic Norman Medieval including
                  Celtic and Saxon aspects. Being a longtime fan of the Middle Ages -- I
                  am very pleasantly surprised at the many spot-on correct details. For
                  example -- the realistic swords -- and swordplay with foul close-combat
                  moves such as pommel-slams, head-butts, heel-trips and grappling --
                  much as in the Fectbuchs fight-books originating from Medieval
                  experience. Then theres the pick-axes and bill-hooks used by calvary to
                  remove footmen and vice versa. The staves, spears and lances drive home
                  their points accurately. The longbows depicted are not fancy-fantasy
                  ones -- but in their stark yew-wood reality. Robin Longstride Russel
                  Crowe spent months learning about Robin Hood and his Norman Medieval
                  setting -- and gained true skill with the longbow by-the-way. The siege
                  equipment on both sides is quite real -- such as missle-weapons,
                  shield-walls, hook-ladders, drop-stones, boil-pots and fire-bags. The
                  other artifacts and usages such as tools, plows, and winches are
                  spot-on. The castles and other dwellings are great in their lush
                  greenwood settings. The production goes well into historical food,
                  drink, manners and customs in those settings -- like the ring-dancing
                  of Robin and Marion. The churches, castles, chapels, manors, houses and
                  lands are incredibly historical -- as well as are the customs of the
                  folks who live in these settings -- such as Lady Marion Cate Blanchett
                  -- who gives a splendidly spirited presentation of the eventual partner
                  of Robin Longstride -- these two leading a great number of excellent
                  actors and acts to initiate the viewer into a GRAPHIC MEDIEVAL EXPANDED
                  SAGA OF ROBIN LONGSTRIDE HOOD. Great when this movie and its sequels
                  are on DVD +++</p>

                  <p>I went into this movie with an open mind. From the trailers and
                  previews, I had no expectations that this was going to follow in the
                  footsteps of classic Robin Hood movies of old. And Scotts Robin Hood
                  delivered. It was a different interpretation that fascinated me and
                  kept me involved throughout. The interweaving of historical characters,
                  like Phillip of France and Richard with the mythical Robin was a
                  delight. For those of you who, like Roger Ebert, cant seem to fathom a
                  different take on the classic tale, you would be wise to avoid this
                  film. But to those of you who want to view a well known meme in a
                  different light, well acted and directed, then this is a movie you
                  would probably enjoy.</p>

                  <p><strong>The worst Robin Hood movie ever</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>This movie is so overlong and boring I almost fell asleep
                  severaltimes. Of course it was never going to be good anyway because
                  all theactors are far too old. I just dont understand why they cast an
                  ugly46-year-old fat thug like Crowe with his huge beer gut and
                  horridgravel voice as Robin Hood. Errol Flynn will always be the best,
                  atleast he was only 28, athletic and actually sounded
                  English.41-year-old Cate Blanchett looks as ugly as sin, is far too old
                  to playMaid Marian, and unsurprisingly has zero chemistry with Crowe.
                  Itwould have been so much better if they had cast younger, British
                  actorslike Christian Bale and Robin and Keira Knightley as Marian
                  instead ofa far too old Crowe and Blanchett. 010. Dont bother, just buy
                  the Errol Flynn masterpiece.</p>

                  <p>Robin Hood was ok, but it definitely doesnt even come close to being
                  as good as its known predecessors. The movie is pretty weak overall.
                  The acting isnt too good here, and Russell Crowe was miscast as the
                  heroic outlaw because of his old age. This is supposed to be the origin
                  story. Robin Hood isnt supposed to be old enough to be King Philips
                  father! This isnt a bad movie, for it is watchable, but dont go out of
                  your way to see it. Rent the 1938 classic instead. Thats a real
                  movie.</p>

                  <p><strong>Very entertaining!</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>I want to say firstly that I hated Gladiator, so if I make
                  anycomparisons at all with this film it is against the other RH films
                  TV series that have gone before. Having read seen some of
                  thePlantagenet 12th13th century history I found this story to be
                  closeenough to the historical mark to be very believable. One reviewer
                  asked why we didnt know what happened to King Johnsfirst wife? The
                  answer was in the film! Johns stated intention ofhaving that marriage
                  annulled so he could marry Isabella was in factwhat happened. It
                  actually paid to have a few clues about this part ofEnglish history.
                  The English barons did finally force John to sign theGreat Charter in
                  1215, which he then went back on his word (with thePopes agreement).
                  Could Maid Marion have worn armour- well Joan of Arcdid 200 years
                  later.. I found this to be a very entertaining, a well spun yarn, well
                  cast great acting by all, and at times some stunning
                  locationsphotography.Did this look like early 13th century England? Yes
                  more so that in anyother films I have seen in the past. I think it
                  stands as the bestRobin Hood film to date Im ready for the next one.

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>The life of Robin Hood is, of course, a vague legend. It concerns an
                  outlawed man who fights for the downtrodden in Englands midlands in the
                  13th century. It is a story that has been reworked many times both on
                  television and in film. In this case, we have Ridley Scott reprising
                  the story with Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett in the starring roles
                  as Robin and Marion. The plot used for this film is arguably
                  implausible. Robin has returned from the Crusades (scarcely one of
                  Christendoms high points) and passes himself off as a man of wealth in
                  Nottingham. He sees the injustice of King John and his heavy handed
                  taxes. In due course, he is forced to be an outlaw and, thus, the
                  legend is born. Crowe and Blanchett are good in their respective roles.
                  However, it is the grandeur and scale of the scenes that really capture
                  the viewers attention. These are truly magnificent. Yet what really
                  excels is the grittiness of the scenes. The castles seem dirty but very
                  believable. There are no Disney type scenes here. Ridley Scott has
                  managed to capture the times well. All too often, films of the middle
                  ages are simply too clean. Here, Robin Hood has cred. So, how to sum
                  up? Well, it a good film without being a great film. Two hours well
                  spent.</p>

                  onedimensional film. With the exception of Max von Sydow (OMG, he was
                  oldin Three Days of the Condor and that was and that was in 1975!)
                  theacting was about as flat as Twiggys chest. Wake up, Russell! A
                  littlemore vim in those sawed off words! Smile once, Cate! Sherwood
                  Forestwont go up in flames. The version with Errol Flynn is still the
                  mostfun. The one with Uma the most enthralling. The one I saw last
                  night,the best cure for insomnia! And JFC, he wasnt called Robin
                  Hoodbecause he was Robin of the hood. RH isnt the frigging Green
                  Arrow,and he didnt grow up in the hood. His name was Robert Hodd and
                  RobinHood was a nickname. I was just disappointed that Russell didnt
                  crowout, I am Maximus Hood. Now, that would have made a bland

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>Ive seen about 4 or 5 Robin Hood movies. My favorite remains the
                  Errol Flynn 1939 version. How does the Robin Hood legend go? The good
                  King Richard goes off to fight honorably and nobly in the Crusades. His
                  evil brother John usurps the throne and exploits the people. Robin of
                  Loxley, the son of a noble landowner, opposes the evil tyranny of the
                  imposter King John. Robin does not oppose the monarchy and remains
                  loyal to the good King Richard. King John outlaws Robin for his
                  opposition to cruely and tyranny, so Robin and his band of outlaws
                  fight for the peoples rights and against King John. The good King
                  Richard is returning from the crusade and King John plans to assinate
                  so John can continue his cruel reign. Robin fights to save the good
                  King Richard and restore him to the thone. The good King rules again
                  and the evil King and his evil henchmen die or are banished from
                  England. So, WHAT is this new Robin Hood story? Anti-royalist?
                  Revolutionary? Lions versus Lambs? My youthful dreams of saving the
                  world are over. The world dont wanna be saved. Lambs are lambs and
                  lions are lions. If lamb became lions the we wouldnt have any lambs. I
                  like lambs better than lions. So kill me you stinkin lions!</p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>Basically Ill keep it short and to the point... Been reading A lot
                  ofthese very lengthy reviews about this film..wow theyre long and
                  dull..This film is without a doubt one of the best Ive seen in a long
                  timeand as a HUGE Russell Crowe fan it was wonderful to see him in the
                  roleof Robin Hood, being all manly and sexy again...sigh. Love the
                  scenewhere lady Marion has to help him off with his chain mail and we
                  ladiesget that much needed look at Russell bare chested..sigh and
                  CateBlanchett was the perfect choice for Lady Marion, what
                  chemistrybetween them as well.. Overall I thought this film was a
                  breath offresh air, finally a more or less historically correct tale of
                  eventsin England during very hard times in the 12th century. It stars
                  abrilliant Kiwi born actor who can do the accent properly alongside
                  acast of extremely talented people... bar Prince John..did not
                  convinceme in that role and I kept thinking of Edmund Blackadder..
                  RowanAtkinson would have been a better choice for the role. Fantastic
                  film, cant wait to own it on DVD and watch it numeroustimes!! Well done
