                  <p>12-year-old Dre Parker couldve been the most popular kid in Detroit,
                  but his mothers latest career move has landed him in China. Dre
                  immediately falls for his classmate Mei Ying - and the feeling is
                  mutual - but cultural differences make such a friendship impossible.
                  Even worse, Dres feelings make an enemy of the class bully, Cheng. In
                  the land of kung fu, Dre knows only a little karate, and Cheng puts the
                  karate kid on the floor with ease. With no friends in a strange land,
                  Dre has nowhere to turn but maintenance man Mr. Han, who is secretly a
                  master of kung fu. As Han teaches Dre that kung fu is not about punches
                  and parries, but maturity and calm, Dre realizes that facing down the
                  bullies will be the fight of his life.</p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>The Karate Kid was a very good movie, and in my opinion better than
                  the original classic. The movie was funny at moments and emotional in
                  others, it made me laugh, cry, and cheer. Also the unique thing about
                  it was it was not a copy cat from the original it had its own
                  storyline, and its own different characters, and frankly Im very proud
                  of the film. Its a feel good, family fun movie, and one for the
                  generation.!!</p>

                  <p><strong>Enjoyable Take On The Karate Kid</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>The Karate Kid stars Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan as the beloved
                  Masterand apprentice who train for a martial arts contest where he
                  mustdefeat his bully and put an end to the embarrassment he has put
                  himthrough. I thought it was enjoyable, sure the plot was bad, but
                  Still, I feltthe chemistry between Chan and Smith. The mom is annoying,
                  it canconnect to many children. So Overall many children will enjoy it,
                  some adults whove seen theoriginal might not be so happy but hey, its
                  the 20s, get to the newages.</p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>Movie was excellent - even if there were 4 previous Karate Kid
                  movies. Jaden may become a formidable action star. He is likable and
                  believable in this movie. The training scenes and actual contest scenes
                  are totally believable. You see Will and Jada in his face.</p>

                  <p><strong>An awful warning</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>I have seen a great many bad movies in my life if any of them
                  wereworse than this, I must have repressed the memory. If I could give
                  thisfilm less than a 1, I would. No one seeing a title like The Karate
                  Kid would expect Tarkovsky.However, you might expect something
                  humorously awful that would be goodto watch for laughs over a few
                  beers. Unfortunately, this one passesthrough the So bad its good zone
                  without even slowing down, and endsup firmly in the realm of So bad its
                  depressing. As far as I can tell, someone basically took a ninth-rate
                  kungfu movie(probably Ninja The Final Duel) and welded on a few scenes
                  - perhapsten minutes in total - featuring Jackie Chan. Mr Chan does not
                  actuallydo any kungfu. He simply ambles on in a dashiki and shades from
                  time totime, cocks his head quizzically and says Shee-it a few times.
                  Helooks gray (literally the color is bad throughout, but appears to
                  beparticularly off during his scenes) and depressed. As well he
                  mightbe. The plot is the usual kungfu mishmash of evil ninjas, virtuous
                  monks,and random ass- kickers who periodically meet up and pound on
                  eachother until someone spits blood and collapses. Among the large cast
                  ofpeople who you wont care about there is a pint sized prince,
                  severalmonks with runny makeup, a cackling arch-villain in what looks
                  like aclean- room bunny suit, a character in a Detroit cap and a Ping
                  PongMan. The original English dialog has been - poorly - dubbed in.
                  Somethingmight have been salvaged from the whole train-wreck if the
                  dialog wereactually amusing, but it isnt. The contribution of the
                  writers seemsto have been to throw in a few lame jokes about
                  African-Americanculture, none of which are even slightly funny. The
                  most disturbingthing about the film might actually be that someone -
                  possibly morethan one person - actually believed that this drivel was
                  witty. Theres no reason for this film to exist, except as an awful
                  warning.There is absolutely no reason for anyone to watch it, ever. Its
                  notcheesy or so bad its good. Its just boring and painful. You willnot
                  miss anything if you dont watch it.</p>

                  <p><strong>Another One of Those HollyWood BULL Movies</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>This is just your typical bull movie where the main character is
                  always going to be some kind of caucasian, or in this case black, and
                  he ends up going to some foreign country, usually somewhere in Asia,
                  and trains for a couple months and becomes a master of whatever
                  material arts or skill that that foreign country is known for. He then
                  is able to use that skill to conquer and defeat everyone in that
                  country, when the natives have been training in the art of martial arts
                  their entire lives. COMPLETE BULL! So this kid just walks into China
                  knowing no martial arts at all and trains for a couple months and
                  suddenly becomes the God of Chinese martials and defeats all those who
                  have been training their whole lives. This is just the same en theme
                  over and over again. Hollywood is just trying to show how the the
                  Western Countries are always going to be dominant in everything because
                  their people are all prodigies and that they only require a couple
                  months to master something that others require a lifetime to do. These
                  Hollywood movies are so full of that its en disgusting. And the sad
                  thing about this is that people eat this up. This is just like the Last
                  Samurai. Come on now, the last samurai is Tom Cruise. Really?</p>

                  <p><strong>Jackie Chan is the only reason to see it</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>Jaden Smith seemed lost and appeared as an amateur. They took
                  tidbits from the original Karate Kid and tried to adapt it to a younger
                  audience, but missed the target miserably. The fight sequences appear
                  staged, not smooth. Jackie Chans fight scene with the young punks is
                  the only reason that anyone should check this movie out. In all
                  honesty, I felt awkward watching Jaden Smith trying to be a headliner,
                  when all along, the movie should have been directed towards Jackie
                  Chan. I think it would have been better had they done what was done in
                  Batman Begins, and shown how the mentor came to be.</p>

                  <p>I loved the movie for the story it told -- Children (and adults)
                  learning respect for others and also to have descipline in their lives.
                  I thought the acting was very well done. The scenery in and around
                  China was done very well I enjoyed looking at it again. I visited China
                  a few years ago and enjoyed seeing places I have been. I will
                  definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD.</p>

                  <p><strong>I wish Will Smith would learn how to title
                  movies</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>I really bugs me that Will Smith steals titles from books and makes
                  movies that bear little resemblance to those books. He did that with I
                  Robot and I am Legend Trust me the books are worth a read. His movies
                  are not bad but the tile rip-off Pies me off.....but I digress. The
                  movie actually does sort of follow the original movie except it is set
                  in China. It reveals an amazing talent in Wills son Jadin Smith. It is
                  not his first role but it will be a memorable one. It is hard to like
                  his character as he is self-obsessed and delusional. We dont have a
                  time line for his training but he certainly learned a lot from the
                  jacket. I personally liked the wax-on...wax-ff) routine in the original
                  movie. Jackie Chan is great in the movie...small comedic glimpses but
                  an excellent dramatic performance. I was not impressed with the mothers
                  role in the movie. I cant say that any mother could watch her son
                  almost destroyed then cheer him on when he comes back....did not seem
                  realistic to me. OVERALL I enjoyed the movie. I have been to China and
                  the parks shown in the movie are the real McCoy...amazing places to go
                  to.</p>

                  <p><strong>Criticism of title silly</strong></p>

                  <div class="Clear"></div>

                  <p>There have been many critiques of the title - get over it. Since
                  whenhas a title ever influenced your opinion of a movie? This movie is
                  an excellent remake of the original. Who knew Jackie Chancould act?
                  Hopefully we see a lot more dramatic parts for him ratherthan the
                  tongue-in-cheek caricature of an action star that he hasbecome. There
                  are a lot of criticisms of Jaden Smith that I have seen and theyare
                  completely unwarranted. His performance at age 10 or 11 isphenomenal.
                  His physical capabilities are a huge plus. There are a fewidiots that
                  believe the original was a superior film. Jaden Smith isphysically more
                  believable at 11 than Ralph Maccio was at age 23(?). This was enjoyable
                  for the whole family and a pleasant surprise. If youwant criticize the
                  film because its a remake or predictable - why didyou go see it?
                  Picking on this film is ridiculous. Just go and enjoy.</p>

                  <p>Its been a long time since I have been to a movie that I have
                  enjoyed as much as this Karate Kid (2010). When I first heard that a
                  remake of Karate Kid was coming out I was less then thrilled with yet
                  another remake. I was wondering why Hollywood would want to improve on
                  the 1984 Karate Kid. But they did and they did it well!. I sure am glad
                  I saw this movie. My 11 year old daughter enjoyed it too and laughed
                  and also cheered on the hero throughout the movie. I would see this
                  movie again and for me thats something that does not happen often.
