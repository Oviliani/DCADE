A unique sample feature application--Internet Calendar Manager--is used throughout the book. The CD-ROM contains :: 111 :: More... :: 112 :: javascript:void(0) :: 113 :: JDK 1.1, the latest release, as well as countless network examples found in the text. :: 114 :: ...Shrink :: 115 :: javascript:void(0) :: 116 :: <BR/> :: 117 :: <STRONG> Review: </STRONG> :: 118 :: <I> Advanced Java Networking </I> :: 119 :: gives the reader a well-rounded and fairly detailed introduction to Java networking technologies. The subjects Sridharan covers sound like a seminar list from a software development conference: IDL/CORBA, RMI, JDBC/SQL, JavaBeans, Castanet, JMAPI, :: 120 :: More... :: 121 :: javascript:void(0) :: 122 :: servlets, and JavaOS, to name a few. But this isn't a dilettantish cursory look at each of many technologies. Rather, this book provides the programmer with the kind of information needed to make solid design and implementation decisions.

The new 1.4 release of Java 2 Standard edition increases the size of the platform by 50%, to 2757 classes in 135 packages. How are you going to figure out what this means for your applications? As always, :: 111 :: <I> Java in a Nutshell </I> :: 112 :: has the answers. The new 4th edition still contains an accelerated introduction to the Java programming language and its key APIs so you can start writing code right away. And with more than 250 new pages, author David Flanagan quickly brings you up to speed on new features that come with version 1.4: :: 113 :: High-performance NIO API :: 114 :: Support for pattern matching with regular expressions :: 115 :: A logging API :: 116 :: A user preferences API :: 117 :: New Collections classes :: 118 :: An XML-based persistence mechanism for Java Beans :: 119 :: Support for XML parsing using both the DOM and SAX APIs :: 120 :: User authentication with the JAAS API :: 121 :: Support for secure network connections using the SSL protocol :: 122 :: Support for cryptography :: 123 :: The book contains O'Reilly's classic quick-reference for all the classes in the essential Java packages, so you can dive in and find what you need to make the new 1.4 version work for you. For as long as Java developers have existed, :: 124 :: <I> Java in a Nutshell </I> :: 125 :: has been ready, willing and able to take you right to the heart of the program, turning those frustrated grrrrss into purrrss of satisfaction.

Includes sections on proven test-taking strategies, warnings on trick questions, time-saving study tips, multiple-part question strategies, and shortcuts. :: 112 :: ...Shrink :: 113 :: javascript:void(0) :: 114 :: <BR/> :: 115 :: <STRONG> Review: </STRONG> :: 116 :: Written for the new or experienced Java developer seeking Sun programmer certification, :: 117 :: <I> Java 2 Exam Prep </I> :: 118 :: provides a concise and quite thorough review of the nuts and bolts of the Java programming language, along with an appealing mix of review questions and hands-on exercises. :: 119 :: The tour of the Java programming language provided in :: 120 :: <I> Java 2 Exam Prep </I> :: 121 :: naturally centers on the basics needed to complete certification. You'll get all the required details here, including everything from keywords, data types, and arrays to designing classes and using built-in APIs like AWT, Swing, and network classes. :: 122 :: But it's the review test questions that are probably the distinguishing feature of this book. Each chapter presents about 20 review questions. (Earlier sections generally have more, and later sections have a few less.) By the end of the book, any reader who carefully works through these problems will have a definite leg up on the certification exam. While other review books certainly provide sample Java questions, the range of quizzed material in :: 123 :: <I> Java 2 Exam Prep </I> :: 124 :: is a standout. :: 125 :: Each chapter also has short hands-on exercises. After reading about basic concepts and necessary APIs and trying out the test questions, you might discover holes in your Java knowledge. The exercises let you build knowledge in weaker areas. The layout of each chapter lets you concentrate on those areas that need the most work. :: 126 :: If the format of :: 127 :: <I> Java 2 Exam Prep </I> :: 128 :: is a winner, its pleasant tone and clearly presented review of essential material can help bring blurry topics into focus. Though the Java certification exams themselves are known for their sometimes arcane detail, the upfront style of :: 129 :: <I> Java 2 Exam Prep </I> :: 130 :: may be just what you need to review Java successfully and earn Java certification. :: 131 :: <I> --Richard Dragan </I> :: 132 :: <B> Topics covered </B> :: 133 :: : The Java certification process, Java data types, installing the JDK, flow control, exceptions, arrays, class design, patterns, garbage collection, thread programming, AWT and JFC/Swing basics, layout managers, event handling, AWT and Java 2D graphics APIs, I/O, SmartCards, and servlet fundamentals. :: 134 :: 	Bookseller & Payment Information :: 135 :: 	<B> Payment Methods </B> :: 136 :: 	This bookseller accepts the following methods of payment: :: 137 :: 	American Express :: 138 :: 	 	JCB :: 139 :: 	MasterCard :: 140 :: 	 	Visa :: 141 :: 	[ :: 142 :: 	Search this Seller's Books :: 143 :: 	/servlet/SearchEntry?vci=50050284 :: 144 :: 	] :: 145 :: 	[ :: 146 :: 	List this Seller's Books :: 147 :: 	/servlet/SearchResults?sortby=0&vci=50050284 :: 148 :: 	] :: 149 :: 	 	 	 	 	Bookseller: :: 150 :: 	Seashellbooks.com Inc :: 151 :: 	/seashellbooks.com-inc-clearwater-fl-u.s.a/50050284/sf :: 152 :: 	<BR/> :: 153 :: 	Address: Clearwater, FL, U.S.A. :: 154 :: 	AbeBooks Bookseller Since: 04 April 2008 :: 155 :: 	<BR/> :: 156 :: 	Bookseller Rating: :: 157 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 158 :: 	http://www.abebooks.com:80/images/servlets/shared/sellerrating/fivestar.gif :: 159 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 160 :: 	Ratings History :: 161 :: 	<B> Terms of Sale: </B> :: 162 :: 	Order additional items within the same shopping cart and receive automated consolidated shipping discounts on all destinations at most shipping levels at checkout.

Bookseller Inventory # V53406719 :: 104 :: Editorial Reviews: :: 105 :: <STRONG> Synopsis: </STRONG> :: 106 :: The 50th anniversary edition of this classic World War 2 adventure set in south-east Asia. :: 107 :: February, 1942: Singapore lies burning and shattered, defenceless before the conquering hordes of the Japanese Army, as the last boat slips out of the harbour into the South China Sea. On board are a desperate group of people, each with a secret to guard, each willing to kill to keep that secret safe.Who or what is the dissolute Englishman, Farnholme? The elegant Dutch planter, Van Effen? The strangely beautiful Eurasian girl, Gudrun? The slave trader, Siran? The smiling and silent Nicholson who is never without his gun? Only one thing is certain: the rotting tramp steamer is a floating death trap, carrying a cargo of human TNT.Dawn sees them far out to sea but with the first murderous dive bombers already aimed at their ship. Thus begins an ordeal few are to survive, a nightmare succession of disasters wrought by the hell-bent Japanese, the unrelenting tropical sun and by the survivors themselves, whose hatred and bitterness divides them one against the other.Written after the acclaimed and phenomenally successful HMS Ulysses and The Guns of Navarone, this was MacLean’s third book, and it contains all the hallmarks of those other two classics. Rich with stunning visual imagery, muscular narrative power, brutality, courage and breathtaking excitement, the celebration of the 50th anniversary of South by Java Head offers readers a long-denied chance to enjoy one of the greatest war novels ever written. :: 108 :: <BR/> :: 109 :: 	Bookseller & Payment Information :: 110 :: 	<B> Payment Methods </B> :: 111 :: 	This bookseller accepts the following methods of payment: :: 112 :: 	American Express :: 113 :: 	 	JCB :: 114 :: 	MasterCard :: 115 :: 	 	Visa :: 116 :: 	[ :: 117 :: 	Search this Seller's Books :: 118 :: 	/servlet/SearchEntry?vci=51218811 :: 119 :: 	] :: 120 :: 	[ :: 121 :: 	List this Seller's Books :: 122 :: 	/servlet/SearchResults?sortby=0&vci=51218811 :: 123 :: 	] :: 124 :: 	[ :: 125 :: 	Ask Bookseller a Question :: 126 :: 	/servlet/AskBooksellerQuestion?reftype=B&refnum=2767669927 :: 127 :: 	] :: 128 :: 	Bookseller: :: 129 :: 	OwlsBooks :: 130 :: 	/owlsbooks-hammond-in-u.s.a/51218811/sf :: 131 :: 	<BR/> :: 132 :: 	Address: Hammond, IN, U.S.A. :: 133 :: 	AbeBooks Bookseller Since: 26 June 2006 :: 134 :: 	<BR/> :: 135 :: 	Bookseller Rating: :: 136 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 137 :: 	http://www.abebooks.com:80/images/servlets/shared/sellerrating/fourstar.gif :: 138 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 139 :: 	Ratings History :: 140 :: 	<B> Terms of Sale: </B> :: 141 :: 	We ship daily! :: 142 :: 	<B> Shipping Terms: </B> :: 143 :: 	We ship daily via USPS Standard/Media mail!

The certification consists of one exam and requires Sun Certified Programmer for Java 2 Platform status. This book is not intended to teach new material. Instead it assumes that you have a solid foundation of knowledge but can use a refresher on important concepts as well as a guide to exam topics and objectives. This book focuses exactly on what you need to pass the exam - it features test-taking strategies, time-saving study tips, and a special Cram Sheet that includes tips, acronyms, and memory joggers not available anywhere else.

Bookseller Inventory # G1861002238I3N00 :: 108 :: Editorial Reviews: :: 109 :: <STRONG> Synopsis: </STRONG> :: 110 :: This book has now been updated to cover JDK 1.3. This updated book is Beginning Java 2- JDK 1.3 edition, by Ivor Horton (ISBN- 1861003668). :: 111 :: The Java 2 platform, which is the release name for JDK 1.2, was released in December 1998. Java 2 is an important stage in the evolution of Java as a serious programming language. There are no substantial changes to the language - instead JavaSoft have focussed on extending class library support for common programming tasks. :: 112 :: This includes an improved, device-independent set of graphics libraries, the Java Foundation Classes (JFC), which includes Swing, Java2D and improved printing. These answer many of the criticisms of the original AWT graphics packages, and are both very flexible and very complete. :: 113 :: There's also a new Collections API, a set of classes to help you look after collections of related objects. There are also substantial changes in threading, serialization and JDBC 2.0. :: 114 :: <BR/> :: 115 :: <STRONG> Review: </STRONG> :: 116 :: <I> Beginning Java 2 </I> :: 117 :: is one of the two best introductory Java 2 books available. (The other is Peter van der Linden's :: 118 :: <I> Just Java 1.2 </I> :: 119 :: .) Assuming nothing more than curiosity and tenacity, this book explains how to create programs with the Java programming language. And :: 120 :: More... :: 121 :: javascript:void(0) :: 122 :: not just simple, academic programs either--the applets and applications that Ivor Horton describes in later chapters take advantage of the latest features of Java 2. :: 123 :: ...Shrink :: 124 :: javascript:void(0) :: 125 :: After a brief introduction to the characteristics of Java, :: 126 :: <I> Beginning Java 2 </I> :: 127 :: digs into variables, data types, operators, control structures, and basic Java syntax--the stuff you absolutely have to understand in order to get anything done. Horton then explains streams, files, and threads before getting into the graphical stuff, where he details how to build attractive, functional user interfaces with the Swing components (with solid coverage of the Java 2 event model). Later chapters address Java2D graphics and database connectivity. The author treats object orientation as integral to the rest of Java programming, which is appropriate to the language. :: 128 :: Readers get to see how concepts work, as regular Try It Out sections include illustrative code listings and the resulting output. The author and publisher deserve kudos for printing the complete source code of example programs rather than just key excerpts. These example programs also appear on the publisher's Web site. :: 129 :: <I> --David Wall </I> :: 130 :: 	Bookseller & Payment Information :: 131 :: 	<B> Payment Methods </B> :: 132 :: 	This bookseller accepts the following methods of payment: :: 133 :: 	American Express :: 134 :: 	 	JCB :: 135 :: 	MasterCard :: 136 :: 	 	Visa :: 137 :: 	[ :: 138 :: 	Search this Seller's Books :: 139 :: 	/servlet/SearchEntry?vci=56019855 :: 140 :: 	] :: 141 :: 	[ :: 142 :: 	List this Seller's Books :: 143 :: 	/servlet/SearchResults?sortby=0&vci=56019855 :: 144 :: 	] :: 145 :: 	[ :: 146 :: 	Ask Bookseller a Question :: 147 :: 	/servlet/AskBooksellerQuestion?reftype=B&refnum=4617515940 :: 148 :: 	] :: 149 :: 	Bookseller: :: 150 :: 	SilverArchBooks.com :: 151 :: 	/silverarchbooks.com-st-louis-mo-u.s.a/56019855/sf :: 152 :: 	<BR/> :: 153 :: 	Address: St Louis, MO, U.S.A. :: 154 :: 	AbeBooks Bookseller Since: 23 December 2010 :: 155 :: 	<BR/> :: 156 :: 	Bookseller Rating: :: 157 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 158 :: 	http://www.abebooks.com:80/images/servlets/shared/sellerrating/fivestar.gif :: 159 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 160 :: 	Ratings History :: 161 :: 	<B> Terms of Sale: </B> :: 162 :: 	We guarantee the condition of every book as it's described on the Abebooks web sites.

Throughout the :: 109 :: More... :: 110 :: javascript:void(0) :: 111 :: book, the authors focus on the features and benefits of each technology, giving readers a well-rounded education in current web development tools and techniques.

This admirably comprehensive book covers virtually everything today's Web :: 118 :: More... :: 119 :: javascript:void(0) :: 120 :: developer needs in order to deliver flexible content for a variety of browsers. :: 121 :: ...Shrink :: 122 :: javascript:void(0) :: 123 :: The book gives you an in-depth tour of XHTML (the XML-based version of HTML) from top to bottom so that you will know what Web content to build on the server. Early chapters go over what's special about XHTML with a full element reference. (Generally speaking, XHTML resembles HTML fairly closely but follows some new conventions.) Using plenty of screen shots, all the basics of Web content designed with XHTML are effectively covered, including how to use image maps, frames, cascading style sheets, and JavaScript. Some particularly good sections lay out the differences between today's browsers (including the different object models and support for DHTML on Netscape and Microsoft browser platforms). :: 124 :: Despite the title of this book (obviously designed to catch the eye of Java readers), it also covers server-side development using CGI (in C), Microsoft ASP, ColdFusion, and PHP. Its cross-language perspective makes this a good choice for anyone evaluating options for server-side development. It also will help readers who are transitioning between technologies. For instance, three short chapters on Allaire ColdFusion will help anyone understand this powerful programming tool quickly. :: 125 :: The book closes with programming done with Java, from client-side applets with AWT and Swing, to server-side development using servlets and JSPs. Final sections show how to combine Java and XML (fulfilling the promise of the title.) :: 126 :: With a wide-ranging tour of at a least a dozen key Web standards and technologies, this text accomplishes a lot more than its title suggests. Written with a clear and patient style and bolstered by plenty of screen shots for the beginner, it'll prove to be a useful resource for almost anyone who does server-side Web development and wants to get a handle on the quickly moving standards surrounding XML, XHTML, and today's newer browsers. :: 127 :: <I> --Richard Dragan </I> :: 128 :: <B> Topics covered: </B> :: 129 :: Tutorial and reference to XHTML :: 130 :: Web page design guidelines :: 131 :: Basic rules of XHTML :: 132 :: Converting HTML :: 133 :: XHMTL 1.0 elements :: 134 :: Image maps (client and server-side) :: 135 :: Using images and graphics (including GIF, JPEG, and PNG formats; animated GIFs; and image anchors) :: 136 :: Tables and frames (including browser dependencies) :: 137 :: HTTP forms tutorial (input field types and passing HTTP form data via URLs) :: 138 :: Cascading style sheets (CSS) :: 139 :: XML tutorial :: 140 :: Creating XML documents :: 141 :: Survey of XML tools, parsers, and editors :: 142 :: SAX API and Document Object Model (DOM) :: 143 :: Related XML standards: using XPath, XPointer, and XLink :: 144 :: XSLT for transforming XML data :: 145 :: Document Type Definitions (DTDs) :: 146 :: Using XSL for displaying XML data (including introduction to WML/WAP and voice display) :: 147 :: Emerging XML standards :: 148 :: JavaScript tutorial :: 149 :: The JavaScript DOM :: 150 :: Client-side form validation with JavaScript :: 151 :: Cookies :: 152 :: Dynamic HTML (DHTML) on Microsoft and Netscape browsers (including cross-browser techniques) :: 153 :: CGI scripts (including environment variables and server-side includes) :: 154 :: Web databases (including flat files and a survey of today's relational database products) :: 155 :: Basic tutorial for Active Server Pages (ASP) development :: 156 :: Tutorial for ColdFusion development (including CFML tags and functions) :: 157 :: Introduction to PHP development :: 158 :: Java 2 tutorial :: 159 :: Applets :: 160 :: Building user interfaces with Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) and Swing components :: 161 :: Basic Java graphics :: 162 :: Java network programming :: 163 :: Java security (including signing JAR files) :: 164 :: Server-side Java primer (servlets and JSPs) :: 165 :: Case study for a syllabus editor using Java and XML :: 166 :: JavaScript reference :: 167 :: 	Bookseller & Payment Information :: 168 :: 	<B> Payment Methods </B> :: 169 :: 	This bookseller accepts the following methods of payment: :: 170 :: 	American Express :: 171 :: 	 	JCB :: 172 :: 	MasterCard :: 173 :: 	 	Visa :: 174 :: 	[ :: 175 :: 	Search this Seller's Books :: 176 :: 	/servlet/SearchEntry?vci=50050284 :: 177 :: 	] :: 178 :: 	[ :: 179 :: 	List this Seller's Books :: 180 :: 	/servlet/SearchResults?sortby=0&vci=50050284 :: 181 :: 	] :: 182 :: 	 	 	 	 	Bookseller: :: 183 :: 	Seashellbooks.com Inc :: 184 :: 	/seashellbooks.com-inc-clearwater-fl-u.s.a/50050284/sf :: 185 :: 	<BR/> :: 186 :: 	Address: Clearwater, FL, U.S.A. :: 187 :: 	AbeBooks Bookseller Since: April 4, 2008 :: 188 :: 	<BR/> :: 189 :: 	Bookseller Rating: :: 190 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 191 :: 	http://www.abebooks.com:80/images/servlets/shared/sellerrating/fivestar.gif :: 192 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 193 :: 	Ratings History :: 194 :: 	<B> Terms of Sale: </B> :: 195 :: 	Order additional items within the same shopping cart and receive automated consolidated shipping discounts on all destinations at most shipping levels at checkout.

Bookseller Inventory # G078971759XI3N00 :: 108 :: Editorial Reviews: :: 109 :: <STRONG> Synopsis: </STRONG> :: 110 :: Web developers must master several technologies to create sophisticated Web sites. Platinum Edition Using HTML 4, XML, and Java 1.2 gives Web developers this information in a concise tutorial/reference style that contains lots of code examples and real world solutions. This book :: 111 :: More... :: 112 :: javascript:void(0) :: 113 :: not only teaches the most popular technologies, but shows Web developers how to build the most popular Web applications, including animation, interactive forms, Web databases, e-commerce, and Web broadcasting. :: 114 :: ...Shrink :: 115 :: javascript:void(0) :: 116 :: <BR/> :: 117 :: <STRONG> Review: </STRONG> :: 118 :: Effective Web development involves wise integration of a number of various programming disciplines and :: 119 :: <I> Using HTML 4, XML, and Java 1.2 </I> :: 120 :: covers a good chunk of them. Aimed at intermediate to advanced level Web developers, this massive guide offers minimal introductory material. :: 121 :: More... :: 122 :: javascript:void(0) :: 123 :: It moves quickly into a section that offers an HTML tag reference and discussions of tables, frames, forms, style sheets, and image maps. This section sets the foundation for Web development and moves at a quick pace. :: 124 :: ...Shrink :: 125 :: javascript:void(0) :: 126 :: The authors then illustrate the basic concepts behind XML and discuss some of the current implementations. They also show how to use JavaScript for client-side scripting, how to implement cookies, and how to control browser objects interactively. :: 127 :: The authors cover the confusing state of Dynamic HTML, describing both Microsoft and Netscape implementations of DHTML and offering suggestions for cross-vendor DHTML use. Chapters on CGI/ASP and Java follow. While all of these sections present extremely key technologies, space constraints limit the discussion to the most important points; don't look for a comprehensive guide to Java programming. Fortunately, the companion CD-ROM fills in many of the blanks with inclusion of five Special Edition titles as well as third-party software programs. :: 128 :: <I> --Stephen W.

Bookseller Inventory # Z0672316005Z2 :: 109 :: Editorial Reviews: :: 110 :: <STRONG> Synopsis: </STRONG> :: 111 :: Developing Java Servlets is a comprehensive, code-intensive book for professional Java developers. It explains the Java Servlet API architecture and client-server development concepts, and contains detailed, professional programming techniques for building sophisticated e-commerce :: 112 :: More... :: 113 :: javascript:void(0) :: 114 :: and database servlet applications. This book explains HTTP, MIME, server-side includes, and other web-based client-server technologies that developers need to understand to build any servlet application. In addition, the book covers JDBC, RMI, CORBA, and other object technologies to the degree are needed to build sophisticated Java servlets. :: 115 :: ...Shrink :: 116 :: javascript:void(0) :: 117 :: <BR/> :: 118 :: <STRONG> Review: </STRONG> :: 119 :: For Java developers, download time and execution performance significantly limit the practical sphere of Java applets. Server-side Java is the key solution. :: 120 :: <I> Developing Java Servlets </I> :: 121 :: presents this important technology for proficient Java developers; however, don't look here for a primer to the base Java language. :: 122 :: While the book includes numerous Java code examples, the lack of a companion CD-ROM is disappointing. And while there is a reference to the publisher's Web site, it wasn't easy to find the URL in the book. The writing is also a bit choppy in places. :: 123 :: To illustrate many of the concepts in the book, a complete sample application is presented. The author uses an online movie catalog system as the book's case study. This example includes database access, user interface implementation, and simple shopping basket features to put the technology in good perspective. :: 124 :: <I> Developing Java Servlets </I> :: 125 :: expects readers to have expertise in Java and a basic understanding of object-oriented programming going in. As long as you have this background, it is a solid manual to the cross-platform server processing architecture. :: 126 :: <I> --Stephen W.

Bookseller Inventory # 110328008 :: 112 :: Editorial Reviews: :: 113 :: <STRONG> Synopsis: </STRONG> :: 114 :: When creating complex Java enterprise applications, do you spend a lot of time thumbing through a myriad of books and other resources searching for what you hope will be the API that's right for the project at hand? :: 115 :: <I> Java Database Best Practices </I> :: 116 :: rescues you from having to wade through books on each of the various APIs before figuring out which method to use! This comprehensive guide introduces each of the dominant APIs (Enterprise JavaBeans, Java Data Objects, the Java Database Connectivity API (JDBC) as well as other, lesser-known options), explores the methodology and design components that use those APIs, and then offers practices most appropriate for different types and makes of databases, as well as different types of applications. :: 117 :: <I> Java Database Practices </I> :: 118 :: also examines database design, from table and database architecture to normalization, and offers a number of best practices for handling these tasks as well. Learn how to move through the various forms of normalization, understand when to denormalize, and even get detailed instructions on optimizing your SQL queries to make the best use of your database structure. Through it all, this book focuses on practical application of these techniques, giving you information that can immediately be applied to your own enterprise projects. :: 119 :: Enterprise applications in today's world are about data-- whether it be information about a product to buy, a user's credit card information, or the color that a customer prefers for their auto purchases. And just as data has grown in importance, the task of accessing that data has grown in complexity. Until now, you have been left on your own to determine which model best suits your application, and how best to use your chosen API. :: 120 :: <I> Java Database Practices </I> :: 121 :: is the one stop reference book to help you determine what's appropriate for your specific project at hand. Whether it's choosing between an alphabet soup of APIs and technologies--EJB, JDO, JDBC, SQL, RDBMS, OODBMS, and more on the horizon, this book is an indispensable resource you can't do without. :: 122 :: <BR/> :: 123 :: 	Bookseller & Payment Information :: 124 :: 	<B> Payment Methods </B> :: 125 :: 	This bookseller accepts the following methods of payment: :: 126 :: 	American Express :: 127 :: 	 	JCB :: 128 :: 	MasterCard :: 129 :: 	 	Visa :: 130 :: 	[ :: 131 :: 	Search this Seller's Books :: 132 :: 	/servlet/SearchEntry?vci=52810420 :: 133 :: 	] :: 134 :: 	[ :: 135 :: 	List this Seller's Books :: 136 :: 	/servlet/SearchResults?sortby=0&vci=52810420 :: 137 :: 	] :: 138 :: 	[ :: 139 :: 	Ask Bookseller a Question :: 140 :: 	/servlet/AskBooksellerQuestion?reftype=B&refnum=4596606317 :: 141 :: 	] :: 142 :: 	Bookseller: :: 143 :: 	Friends Book Sale, LLC :: 144 :: 	/friends-book-sale%2c-llc-tucker-ga/52810420/sf :: 145 :: 	<BR/> :: 146 :: 	Address: Tucker, GA, U.S.A. :: 147 :: 	AbeBooks Bookseller Since: 15 October 2007 :: 148 :: 	<BR/> :: 149 :: 	Bookseller Rating: :: 150 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 151 :: 	http://www.abebooks.com:80/images/servlets/shared/sellerrating/fivestar.gif :: 152 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 153 :: 	Ratings History :: 154 :: 	<B> Terms of Sale: </B> :: 155 :: 	We guarantee the condition of every book as it's described on the Abebooks web sites.

Bookseller Inventory # V30288702 :: 109 :: Editorial Reviews: :: 110 :: <STRONG> Synopsis: </STRONG> :: 111 :: Distributed computing and Java go together naturally. As the first language designed from the bottom up with networking in mind, Java makes it very easy for computers to cooperate. Even the simplest applet running in a browser is a distributed application, if you think about it. The client running the browser downloads and executes code that is delivered by some other system. But even this simple applet wouldn't be possible without Java's guarantees of portability and security: the applet can run on any platform, and can't sabotage its host. :: 112 :: Of course, when we think of distributed computing, we usually think of applications more complex than a client and server communicating with the same protocol. We usually think in terms of programs that make remote procedure calls, access remote databases, and collaborate with others to produce a single result. :: 113 :: <I> Java Distributed Computing </I> :: 114 :: discusses how to design and write such applications. It covers Java's RMI (Remote Method Invocation) facility and CORBA, but it doesn't stop there; it tells you how to design your own protocols to build message passing systems and discusses how to use Java's security facilities, how to write multithreaded servers, and more. It pays special attention to distributed data systems, collaboration, and applications that have high bandwidth requirements. :: 115 :: In the future, distributed computing can only become more important. :: 116 :: <I> Java Distributed Computing </I> :: 117 :: provides a broad introduction to the problems you'll face and the solutions you'll find as you write distributed computing applications. :: 118 :: Topics covered in :: 119 :: <I> Java Distributed Computing </I> :: 120 :: : :: 121 :: Introduction to Distributed Computing :: 122 :: Networking Basics :: 123 :: Distributed Objects (Overview of CORBA and RMI) :: 124 :: Threads :: 125 :: Security :: 126 :: Message Passing Systems :: 127 :: Distributed Data Systems (Databases) :: 128 :: Bandwidth Limited Applications :: 129 :: Collaborative Systems :: 130 :: <BR/> :: 131 :: <STRONG> Review: </STRONG> :: 132 :: This thorough guide explains how to harness the power of Java to create distributed systems, which the author defines as a group of agents working together across multiple systems. :: 133 :: In order to create distributed applications, Java programmers need to be familiar with a host of technologies and language features in Java. These include Java's networking capabilities, its threading model, CORBA, Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI), and the JDBC standard for connecting to databases. :: 134 :: <I> Java Distributed Computing </I> :: 135 :: is a step-by-step guide to all of these pieces of the puzzle, presented in a concise, usable format. :: 136 :: The author presents each topic in digestible increments with some illustrative Java code, including a distributed game of chess, a chat application, and a whiteboard application. Advanced chapters cover security issues and dealing with limited bandwidth applications (such as pagers or Web browsers). Useful appendices list the fundamentals of CORBA, RMI, and JavaSpaces to make it easy for the working developer to look them up. :: 137 :: <I> --Richard Dragan </I> :: 138 :: 	Bookseller & Payment Information :: 139 :: 	<B> Payment Methods </B> :: 140 :: 	This bookseller accepts the following methods of payment: :: 141 :: 	American Express :: 142 :: 	 	JCB :: 143 :: 	MasterCard :: 144 :: 	 	Visa :: 145 :: 	[ :: 146 :: 	Search this Seller's Books :: 147 :: 	/servlet/SearchEntry?vci=51218811 :: 148 :: 	] :: 149 :: 	[ :: 150 :: 	List this Seller's Books :: 151 :: 	/servlet/SearchResults?sortby=0&vci=51218811 :: 152 :: 	] :: 153 :: 	[ :: 154 :: 	Ask Bookseller a Question :: 155 :: 	/servlet/AskBooksellerQuestion?reftype=B&refnum=2060478594 :: 156 :: 	] :: 157 :: 	Bookseller: :: 158 :: 	OwlsBooks :: 159 :: 	/owlsbooks-hammond-in-u.s.a/51218811/sf :: 160 :: 	<BR/> :: 161 :: 	Address: Hammond, IN, U.S.A. :: 162 :: 	AbeBooks Bookseller Since: June 26, 2006 :: 163 :: 	<BR/> :: 164 :: 	Bookseller Rating: :: 165 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 166 :: 	http://www.abebooks.com:80/images/servlets/shared/sellerrating/fourstar.gif :: 167 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 168 :: 	Ratings History :: 169 :: 	<B> Terms of Sale: </B> :: 170 :: 	We ship daily! :: 171 :: 	<B> Shipping Terms: </B> :: 172 :: 	We ship daily via USPS Standard/Media mail!

UNMARKED TEXT. HAS USUAL LIBRARY MARKINGS. STANDARD LIBRARY WEAR. Bookseller Inventory # 182.102 :: 112 :: Editorial Reviews: :: 113 :: <STRONG> Synopsis: </STRONG> :: 114 :: QuickTime Java (QJT) is a terrific multimedia toolkit, but it's also terrifying to the uninitiated. Java developers who need to add audio, video, or interactive media creation and playback to their applications find that QTJ is powerful, but not easy to get into. In fact, when it comes to class-count, QuickTime Java is nearly as large as all of Java 1.1. :: 115 :: Once you learn the entire scope of Apple's QuickTime software, you really appreciate the problem. At its simplest, QuickTime allows Mac and Windows users to play audio and video on their computers. But QuickTime is many things: a file format, an environment for media authoring, and a suite of applications that includes browser plug-ins for viewing media within a web page, a PictureViewer for working with still pictures, QuickTime Streaming Server for delivering streaming media files on the Internet in real time, and QuickTime Broadcaster for delivering live events on the Internet. Among others. :: 116 :: As if that weren't daunting enough, the javadocs on QJT are wildly incomplete, and other books on the topic are long out of date and not well regarded, making progress with QTJ extremely difficult. So what can you do? Our new hands-on guide, :: 117 :: <I> QuickTime Java: A Developer's Notebook </I> :: 118 :: , not only catches up with this technology, but de-mystifies it. :: 119 :: This practical all lab, no lecture book is an informal, code-intensive workbook that offers the first real look at this important software. Like other titles in our Developer's Notebook series, :: 120 :: <I> QuickTime Java: A Developer's Notebook </I> :: 121 :: is for impatient early adopters who want get up to speed on what they can use right now. It's deliberately light on theory, emphasizing example over explanation and practice over concept, so you can focus on learning by doing. :: 122 :: <I> QuickTime Java: A Developer's Notebook </I> :: 123 :: gives you just the functionality you need from QTJ. Even if you come to realize that 95% of the API is irrelevant to you, this book will help you master the 5% that really counts. :: 124 :: <BR/> :: 125 :: 	Bookseller & Payment Information :: 126 :: 	<B> Payment Methods </B> :: 127 :: 	This bookseller accepts the following methods of payment: :: 128 :: 	American Express :: 129 :: 	 	JCB :: 130 :: 	MasterCard :: 131 :: 	 	Visa :: 132 :: 	[ :: 133 :: 	Search this Seller's Books :: 134 :: 	/servlet/SearchEntry?vci=54337422 :: 135 :: 	] :: 136 :: 	[ :: 137 :: 	List this Seller's Books :: 138 :: 	/servlet/SearchResults?sortby=0&vci=54337422 :: 139 :: 	] :: 140 :: 	[ :: 141 :: 	Ask Bookseller a Question :: 142 :: 	/servlet/AskBooksellerQuestion?reftype=B&refnum=4407672708 :: 143 :: 	] :: 144 :: 	Bookseller: :: 145 :: 	PLANET BOOKS :: 146 :: 	/planet-books-port-st-lucie-fl/54337422/sf :: 147 :: 	<BR/> :: 148 :: 	Address: PORT ST.

Bookseller Inventory # 99767333 :: 109 :: Editorial Reviews: :: 110 :: <B> Synopsis: </B> :: 111 :: -- Explains how to develop Java programs for connecting to databases using the newest version of Java's database connectivity standard, JDBC. -- Shows how to write JDBC drivers and how to select the right one. -- Includes a complete reference to the newest JDBC API specification. :: 112 :: <STRONG> Review: </STRONG> :: 113 :: <I> Java Database Programming with JDBC </I> :: 114 :: by Pratik Patel and Karl Moss is an updated edition of the authors' guide to the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) standard for database programming under Java. While the original edition was perhaps geared more to those developers who :: 115 :: More... :: 116 :: javascript:void(0) :: 117 :: needed to write their own JDBC database drivers, a fairly arduous task, this new edition provides more background information on database connectivity issues in Java and so will be even more useful to the casual or intermediate programmer. After a general introduction to JDBC and Structured Query Language (SQL), useful even to beginning programmers, the authors start by building a simple database-aware applet. New chapters on servlets, Java components that run on the server-side and manage database operations, as well as a general discussion of middleware technologies are particularly good. Database access for JavaBean components (from Sun Microsystems JDK 1.1) is also discussed, including working code for two database-aware beans. This book also includes a quick introduction to the Java language (which will only be helpful if you already know C/C++), a detailed reference for the JDBC API, and a working example of a text-based JDBC driver. Though this book is still oriented toward the JDBC driver developer, the authors now provide enough general discussion of JDBC architectural issues to make it worthwhile to any programmer who needs to ramp up on what JDBC is and what capabilities it offers. :: 118 :: ...Shrink :: 119 :: javascript:void(0) :: 120 :: 	Bookseller & Payment Information :: 121 :: 	<B> Payment Methods </B> :: 122 :: 	This bookseller accepts the following methods of payment: :: 123 :: 	American Express :: 124 :: 	 	JCB :: 125 :: 	MasterCard :: 126 :: 	 	Visa :: 127 :: 	[ :: 128 :: 	Search this Seller's Books :: 129 :: 	/servlet/SearchEntry?vci=53899894 :: 130 :: 	] :: 131 :: 	[ :: 132 :: 	List this Seller's Books :: 133 :: 	/servlet/SearchResults?sortby=0&vci=53899894 :: 134 :: 	] :: 135 :: 	[ :: 136 :: 	Ask Bookseller a Question :: 137 :: 	/servlet/AskBooksellerQuestion?reftype=B&refnum=4884382359 :: 138 :: 	] :: 139 :: 	Bookseller: :: 140 :: 	BearBooks :: 141 :: 	/bearbooks-woonsocket-ri-u.s.a/53899894/sf :: 142 :: 	<BR/> :: 143 :: 	Address: Woonsocket, RI, U.S.A. :: 144 :: 	AbeBooks Bookseller Since: March 6, 2009 :: 145 :: 	<BR/> :: 146 :: 	Bookseller Rating: :: 147 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 148 :: 	http://www.abebooks.com:80/images/servlets/shared/sellerrating/fourstar.gif :: 149 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 150 :: 	Ratings History :: 151 :: 	<B> Terms of Sale: </B> :: 152 :: 	We guarantee the condition of every book as it's described on the Abebooks web sites.

This highly acclaimed and well-recognized study guide provides an intense preparation program for programmers gearing up for the Sun Certified Java Programmer, Java 2 exam (310-025). :: 112 :: More... :: 113 :: javascript:void(0) :: 114 :: The book's well organized, concise layout provides thorough coverage of test content and objectives like learning Java language fundamentals, creating Java classes, building GUIs with the AWT Components, and working with flow control and exceptions. Includes the proven Exam Cram features of helpful hints and tips, test taking strategies, realistic case studies, tear-out cram sheets, and challenging practice questions. :: 115 :: ...Shrink :: 116 :: javascript:void(0) :: 117 :: <BR/> :: 118 :: <STRONG> Review: </STRONG> :: 119 :: Written for the new or experienced Java developer seeking Sun programmer certification, :: 120 :: <I> Java 2 Exam Prep </I> :: 121 :: provides a concise and quite thorough review of the nuts and bolts of the Java programming language, along with an appealing mix of review questions and hands-on exercises. :: 122 :: The tour of the Java programming language provided in :: 123 :: <I> Java 2 Exam Prep </I> :: 124 :: naturally centers on the basics needed to complete certification. You'll get all the required details here, including everything from keywords, data types, and arrays to designing classes and using built-in APIs like AWT, Swing, and network classes. :: 125 :: But it's the review test questions that are probably the distinguishing feature of this book. Each chapter presents about 20 review questions. (Earlier sections generally have more, and later sections have a few less.) By the end of the book, any reader who carefully works through these problems will have a definite leg up on the certification exam. While other review books certainly provide sample Java questions, the range of quizzed material in :: 126 :: <I> Java 2 Exam Prep </I> :: 127 :: is a standout. :: 128 :: Each chapter also has short hands-on exercises. After reading about basic concepts and necessary APIs and trying out the test questions, you might discover holes in your Java knowledge. The exercises let you build knowledge in weaker areas. The layout of each chapter lets you concentrate on those areas that need the most work. :: 129 :: If the format of :: 130 :: <I> Java 2 Exam Prep </I> :: 131 :: is a winner, its pleasant tone and clearly presented review of essential material can help bring blurry topics into focus. Though the Java certification exams themselves are known for their sometimes arcane detail, the upfront style of :: 132 :: <I> Java 2 Exam Prep </I> :: 133 :: may be just what you need to review Java successfully and earn Java certification. :: 134 :: <I> --Richard Dragan </I> :: 135 :: <B> Topics covered </B> :: 136 :: : The Java certification process, Java data types, installing the JDK, flow control, exceptions, arrays, class design, patterns, garbage collection, thread programming, AWT and JFC/Swing basics, layout managers, event handling, AWT and Java 2D graphics APIs, I/O, SmartCards, and servlet fundamentals. :: 137 :: 	Bookseller & Payment Information :: 138 :: 	<B> Payment Methods </B> :: 139 :: 	This bookseller accepts the following methods of payment: :: 140 :: 	American Express :: 141 :: 	 	JCB :: 142 :: 	MasterCard :: 143 :: 	 	Visa :: 144 :: 	[ :: 145 :: 	Search this Seller's Books :: 146 :: 	/servlet/SearchEntry?vci=903879 :: 147 :: 	] :: 148 :: 	[ :: 149 :: 	List this Seller's Books :: 150 :: 	/servlet/SearchResults?sortby=0&vci=903879 :: 151 :: 	] :: 152 :: 	[ :: 153 :: 	Ask Bookseller a Question :: 154 :: 	/servlet/AskBooksellerQuestion?reftype=B&refnum=2011282296 :: 155 :: 	] :: 156 :: 	Bookseller: :: 157 :: 	Page Master Used Books :: 158 :: 	/page-master-used-books-front-royal/903879/sf :: 159 :: 	<BR/> :: 160 :: 	Address: Front Royal, VA, U.S.A. :: 161 :: 	AbeBooks Bookseller Since: July 9, 2001 :: 162 :: 	<BR/> :: 163 :: 	Bookseller Rating: :: 164 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 165 :: 	http://www.abebooks.com:80/images/servlets/shared/sellerrating/fourstar.gif :: 166 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 167 :: 	Ratings History :: 168 :: 	<B> Terms of Sale: </B> :: 169 :: 	Credit cards accepted.

Bookseller Inventory # 101708869 :: 109 :: Editorial Reviews: :: 110 :: <STRONG> Synopsis: </STRONG> :: 111 :: Platinum Edition XHTML, XML and Java 2 is separated into several sections, each of which focuses on a specific technology, including XHTML, XML, JavaScript, Dynamic HTML, CGI programming with Perl, Server-side Programming with ASP, ColdFusion and PHP, and Java 2. Throughout the :: 112 :: More... :: 113 :: javascript:void(0) :: 114 :: book, the authors focus on the features and benefits of each technology, giving readers a well-rounded education in current web development tools and techniques. In addition, the authors demonstrate the value of combining various technologies (such as Java and XML) for more powerful web solutions. :: 115 :: ...Shrink :: 116 :: javascript:void(0) :: 117 :: <BR/> :: 118 :: <STRONG> Review: </STRONG> :: 119 :: <I> Platinum Edition Using XHTML, XML, and Java 2 </I> :: 120 :: shows how to combine these three powerful standards--and plenty of others--to deliver flexible Web content on a variety of platforms, including Java. This admirably comprehensive book covers virtually everything today's Web :: 121 :: More... :: 122 :: javascript:void(0) :: 123 :: developer needs in order to deliver flexible content for a variety of browsers. :: 124 :: ...Shrink :: 125 :: javascript:void(0) :: 126 :: The book gives you an in-depth tour of XHTML (the XML-based version of HTML) from top to bottom so that you will know what Web content to build on the server. Early chapters go over what's special about XHTML with a full element reference. (Generally speaking, XHTML resembles HTML fairly closely but follows some new conventions.) Using plenty of screen shots, all the basics of Web content designed with XHTML are effectively covered, including how to use image maps, frames, cascading style sheets, and JavaScript. Some particularly good sections lay out the differences between today's browsers (including the different object models and support for DHTML on Netscape and Microsoft browser platforms). :: 127 :: Despite the title of this book (obviously designed to catch the eye of Java readers), it also covers server-side development using CGI (in C), Microsoft ASP, ColdFusion, and PHP. Its cross-language perspective makes this a good choice for anyone evaluating options for server-side development. It also will help readers who are transitioning between technologies. For instance, three short chapters on Allaire ColdFusion will help anyone understand this powerful programming tool quickly. :: 128 :: The book closes with programming done with Java, from client-side applets with AWT and Swing, to server-side development using servlets and JSPs. Final sections show how to combine Java and XML (fulfilling the promise of the title.) :: 129 :: With a wide-ranging tour of at a least a dozen key Web standards and technologies, this text accomplishes a lot more than its title suggests. Written with a clear and patient style and bolstered by plenty of screen shots for the beginner, it'll prove to be a useful resource for almost anyone who does server-side Web development and wants to get a handle on the quickly moving standards surrounding XML, XHTML, and today's newer browsers. :: 130 :: <I> --Richard Dragan </I> :: 131 :: <B> Topics covered: </B> :: 132 :: Tutorial and reference to XHTML :: 133 :: Web page design guidelines :: 134 :: Basic rules of XHTML :: 135 :: Converting HTML :: 136 :: XHMTL 1.0 elements :: 137 :: Image maps (client and server-side) :: 138 :: Using images and graphics (including GIF, JPEG, and PNG formats; animated GIFs; and image anchors) :: 139 :: Tables and frames (including browser dependencies) :: 140 :: HTTP forms tutorial (input field types and passing HTTP form data via URLs) :: 141 :: Cascading style sheets (CSS) :: 142 :: XML tutorial :: 143 :: Creating XML documents :: 144 :: Survey of XML tools, parsers, and editors :: 145 :: SAX API and Document Object Model (DOM) :: 146 :: Related XML standards: using XPath, XPointer, and XLink :: 147 :: XSLT for transforming XML data :: 148 :: Document Type Definitions (DTDs) :: 149 :: Using XSL for displaying XML data (including introduction to WML/WAP and voice display) :: 150 :: Emerging XML standards :: 151 :: JavaScript tutorial :: 152 :: The JavaScript DOM :: 153 :: Client-side form validation with JavaScript :: 154 :: Cookies :: 155 :: Dynamic HTML (DHTML) on Microsoft and Netscape browsers (including cross-browser techniques) :: 156 :: CGI scripts (including environment variables and server-side includes) :: 157 :: Web databases (including flat files and a survey of today's relational database products) :: 158 :: Basic tutorial for Active Server Pages (ASP) development :: 159 :: Tutorial for ColdFusion development (including CFML tags and functions) :: 160 :: Introduction to PHP development :: 161 :: Java 2 tutorial :: 162 :: Applets :: 163 :: Building user interfaces with Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) and Swing components :: 164 :: Basic Java graphics :: 165 :: Java network programming :: 166 :: Java security (including signing JAR files) :: 167 :: Server-side Java primer (servlets and JSPs) :: 168 :: Case study for a syllabus editor using Java and XML :: 169 :: JavaScript reference :: 170 :: 	Bookseller & Payment Information :: 171 :: 	<B> Payment Methods </B> :: 172 :: 	This bookseller accepts the following methods of payment: :: 173 :: 	American Express :: 174 :: 	 	JCB :: 175 :: 	MasterCard :: 176 :: 	 	Visa :: 177 :: 	[ :: 178 :: 	Search this Seller's Books :: 179 :: 	/servlet/SearchEntry?vci=53899894 :: 180 :: 	] :: 181 :: 	[ :: 182 :: 	List this Seller's Books :: 183 :: 	/servlet/SearchResults?sortby=0&vci=53899894 :: 184 :: 	] :: 185 :: 	[ :: 186 :: 	Ask Bookseller a Question :: 187 :: 	/servlet/AskBooksellerQuestion?reftype=B&refnum=4981386105 :: 188 :: 	] :: 189 :: 	Bookseller: :: 190 :: 	BearBooks :: 191 :: 	/bearbooks-woonsocket-ri-u.s.a/53899894/sf :: 192 :: 	<BR/> :: 193 :: 	Address: Woonsocket, RI, U.S.A. :: 194 :: 	AbeBooks Bookseller Since: 06 March 2009 :: 195 :: 	<BR/> :: 196 :: 	Bookseller Rating: :: 197 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 198 :: 	http://www.abebooks.com:80/images/servlets/shared/sellerrating/fourstar.gif :: 199 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 200 :: 	Ratings History :: 201 :: 	<B> Terms of Sale: </B> :: 202 :: 	We guarantee the condition of every book as it's described on the Abebooks web sites.

Bookseller Inventory # 66F21A3232956 BW :: 106 :: Editorial Reviews: :: 107 :: <STRONG> Synopsis: </STRONG> :: 108 :: Serves as the perfect complement to all study guides and training materials for the Sun Certified Java JDK 1.2 Programmer Exam. The best way to build confidence is through study of example questions similar to those on the real exam and this book will have numerous examples and :: 109 :: More... :: 110 :: javascript:void(0) :: 111 :: a complete practice exam. Includes sections on proven test-taking strategies, warnings on trick questions, time-saving study tips, multiple-part question strategies, and shortcuts. :: 112 :: ...Shrink :: 113 :: javascript:void(0) :: 114 :: <BR/> :: 115 :: <STRONG> Review: </STRONG> :: 116 :: Written for the new or experienced Java developer seeking Sun programmer certification, :: 117 :: <I> Java 2 Exam Prep </I> :: 118 :: provides a concise and quite thorough review of the nuts and bolts of the Java programming language, along with an appealing mix of review questions and hands-on exercises. :: 119 :: The tour of the Java programming language provided in :: 120 :: <I> Java 2 Exam Prep </I> :: 121 :: naturally centers on the basics needed to complete certification. You'll get all the required details here, including everything from keywords, data types, and arrays to designing classes and using built-in APIs like AWT, Swing, and network classes. :: 122 :: But it's the review test questions that are probably the distinguishing feature of this book. Each chapter presents about 20 review questions. (Earlier sections generally have more, and later sections have a few less.) By the end of the book, any reader who carefully works through these problems will have a definite leg up on the certification exam. While other review books certainly provide sample Java questions, the range of quizzed material in :: 123 :: <I> Java 2 Exam Prep </I> :: 124 :: is a standout. :: 125 :: Each chapter also has short hands-on exercises. After reading about basic concepts and necessary APIs and trying out the test questions, you might discover holes in your Java knowledge. The exercises let you build knowledge in weaker areas. The layout of each chapter lets you concentrate on those areas that need the most work. :: 126 :: If the format of :: 127 :: <I> Java 2 Exam Prep </I> :: 128 :: is a winner, its pleasant tone and clearly presented review of essential material can help bring blurry topics into focus. Though the Java certification exams themselves are known for their sometimes arcane detail, the upfront style of :: 129 :: <I> Java 2 Exam Prep </I> :: 130 :: may be just what you need to review Java successfully and earn Java certification. :: 131 :: <I> --Richard Dragan </I> :: 132 :: <B> Topics covered </B> :: 133 :: : The Java certification process, Java data types, installing the JDK, flow control, exceptions, arrays, class design, patterns, garbage collection, thread programming, AWT and JFC/Swing basics, layout managers, event handling, AWT and Java 2D graphics APIs, I/O, SmartCards, and servlet fundamentals. :: 134 :: 	Bookseller & Payment Information :: 135 :: 	<B> Payment Methods </B> :: 136 :: 	This bookseller accepts the following methods of payment: :: 137 :: 	American Express :: 138 :: 	 	JCB :: 139 :: 	MasterCard :: 140 :: 	 	Visa :: 141 :: 	[ :: 142 :: 	Search this Seller's Books :: 143 :: 	/servlet/SearchEntry?vci=50050284 :: 144 :: 	] :: 145 :: 	[ :: 146 :: 	List this Seller's Books :: 147 :: 	/servlet/SearchResults?sortby=0&vci=50050284 :: 148 :: 	] :: 149 :: 	 	 	 	 	Bookseller: :: 150 :: 	Seashellbooks.com Inc :: 151 :: 	/seashellbooks.com-inc-clearwater-fl-u.s.a/50050284/sf :: 152 :: 	<BR/> :: 153 :: 	Address: Clearwater, FL, U.S.A. :: 154 :: 	AbeBooks Bookseller Since: April 4, 2008 :: 155 :: 	<BR/> :: 156 :: 	Bookseller Rating: :: 157 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 158 :: 	http://www.abebooks.com:80/images/servlets/shared/sellerrating/fivestar.gif :: 159 :: 	javascript:openNewWindow('/servlet/FrameBase?content=%2Fservlet%2FViewSellerRatingsHelp',500,%20550,'yes'); :: 160 :: 	Ratings History :: 161 :: 	<B> Terms of Sale: </B> :: 162 :: 	Order additional items within the same shopping cart and receive automated consolidated shipping discounts on all destinations at most shipping levels at checkout.
