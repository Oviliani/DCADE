This Castle, between history and myth is the living symbol of the research (Virgilio). A rock between see and ground, a stone between underground and sky become a perfect location for an international conference, a meeting point between past and future. This communion has been, for more then 20 years, the philosophy of our society: young surgeons meet the experience of skilled surgeons, showing their art, solving their doubts and reaching their knowledge of mastership.When a surgeon is not anymore a young apprentices and not jet an experienced masters, then I believe is a young surgeon. This Conference hasn't age restrictions, is dedicated to that never-old part of every surgery will always need to learn, what make our work an extraordinary work! That's the reason, I've dedicated this conference to my father (the honorary president), my guide, my master, who has teached me to love this work! Unfortunately like to lovers often happen, we're now living hard times in surgery for money and feelings. Catullo in his Disillusion Carmen LXXII reminds us: ...quod amantem iniura talis cogit amare magis, sed bene velle minus. that's the feeling of many young surgeons (surgery and disillusion) and I would say this is the main topic of my Conference. Bioethic, Biotechnology, Research, Education, New Technology, Risk Management are other topics will be developed with a multidisciplinary approach. One of the reason of our National Conference success (2500 contact, 1500 confernce subscriptions, 1300 associates, 400 abstracts published on the European Journal of Surgical Research and more then 200 lectures)is our multidisciplinary approach to Specialties: Anesthesiology, Anal and Colo-Rectal Surgery, Bariatric Surgery, Cardio-Vascular Surgery, Day Surgery, Emergency Surgery, Endocrine Surgery, Endoscopy, Experimental Surgery, Gynecology, Hernia Surgery, HPB Surgery, Interventional Radiology, Minimally Invasive Surgery, NOTES, Neurosurgery, Opthalmology, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Orthopedics, Otolaryngology, Pediatric Surgery, Plastic Surgery, Thoracic Surgery, Transplantation, Upper G.I. Surgery, Urology.

Business users are more active than ever in the publication and consumption of information. However, many organizations are struggling to engage Business users in managing the information they create and consume so that it can easily be found and reused. Business Taxonomies can provide solutions to an organization’s Knowledge Management challenges. Although the concept of Taxonomies is not new, organizations are beginning to focus increased attention on the design and development of intuitive and sustainable Taxonomies that will serve their end users by making it easy to find the information they need in a single place. Today’s users have come to expect a simple way to both search and browse for their information, but still many organizations do not know where to begin in the design of such a system. :: 137 :: <BR/> :: 138 :: This seminar will provide an introduction to Taxonomy and Metadata benefits, design concepts and implementation strategies. Major barriers to successfully implementing a Business Taxonomy will be identified. Detail on a practical design methodology that will allow you to begin designing a Business Taxonomy for your own organization will be provided. The requirements for and variety of tools for managing Taxonomies and related information will be described and discussed. The seminar will discuss how consistently applied Taxonomy and Metadata schemes may be used for system interoperability and advanced navigation such as faceted browsing. The seminar will cover Taxonomy Best Practices, a wide variety of actual Case Studies, and implementation methodologies. :: 139 :: <BR/> :: 140 :: <BR/> :: 141 :: What you will learn :: 142 :: <BR/> :: 143 :: How to design and sustain Business Taxonomies within your organization :: 144 :: <BR/> :: 145 :: The value of Taxonomies and Metadata :: 146 :: <BR/> :: 147 :: Best practices for successful implementation and adoption :: 148 :: <BR/> :: 149 :: The various approaches organizations have used to develop Taxonomies :: 150 :: <BR/> :: 151 :: The common mistakes organization make in developing Taxonomies :: 152 :: <BR/> :: 153 :: Best Practices for Governance of your Knowledge Management projects :: 154 :: <BR/> :: 155 :: How to get started developing your own organization’s categorization structure :: 156 :: <BR/> :: 157 :: What are Taxonomy tools and how should you evaluate them :: 158 :: <BR/> :: 159 :: How do Taxonomies improve search results :: 160 :: <BR/> :: 161 :: How can Taxonomies be used to build more effective search applications :: 162 :: <BR/> :: 163 :: Main Topics :: 164 :: <BR/> :: 165 :: Introduction to Taxonomies :: 166 :: <BR/> :: 167 :: Introduction to Metadata :: 168 :: <BR/> :: 169 :: Project Methodologies :: 170 :: <BR/> :: 171 :: Project Risks and Mitigation Strategies :: 172 :: <BR/> :: 173 :: Running Taxonomy Design Workshops for Your Organization :: 174 :: <BR/> :: 175 :: Validating Taxonomies :: 176 :: <BR/> :: 177 :: Measure and Improve Mindset :: 178 :: <BR/> :: 179 :: KM Governance Best Practices :: 180 :: <BR/> :: 181 :: Taxonomy Management Tools :: 182 :: <BR/> :: 183 :: Taxonomy and Search :: 184 :: <BR/> :: 185 :: Taxonomy and Information Management Applications: How Taxonomies Help you Save and Make Money, and Stay out of Jail :: 186 :: 	Additional Information :: 187 :: 	For further information please do not hesitate to contact us at info@technologytransfer.it or visit our website at www.technologytransfer.eu :: 188 :: <BR/> :: 189 :: <BR/> :: 190 :: 	Home :: 191 :: 	http://www.AllConferences.Com :: 192 :: 	| :: 193 :: 	Submit A Conference :: 194 :: 	http://www.AllConferences.Com/New :: 195 :: 	| :: 196 :: 	Search :: 197 :: 	http://www.AllConferences.Com/Search :: 198 :: 	| :: 199 :: 	Linking Information :: 200 :: 	http://www.AllConferences.Com/link.htm :: 201 :: 	<BR/> :: 202 :: 	Tours :: 203 :: 	http://www.affordabletours.com :: 204 :: 	Cruises :: 205 :: 	http://cruises.affordabletours.com/ :: 206 :: 	River Cruises :: 207 :: 	http://rivers.affordabletours.com/ :: 208 :: 	Resorts :: 209 :: 	http://resorts.affordabletours.com/ :: 210 :: 	Travel Guide :: 211 :: 	http://travelguide.affordabletours.com/ :: 212 :: 	<BR/> :: 213 :: 	Globus Tours :: 214 :: 	http://www.affordabletours.com/Globus_Tours :: 215 :: 	Trafalgar Tours :: 216 :: 	http://www.affordabletours.com/Trafalgar_Tours :: 217 :: 	Insight Tours :: 218 :: 	http://www.affordabletours.com/Insight_Tours :: 219 :: 	Tauck Tours :: 220 :: 	http://www.affordableTours.com/Tauck_Tours :: 221 :: 	Carnival Cruises :: 222 :: 	http://cruises.affordabletours.com/Carnival_Cruises :: 223 :: 	Celebrity Cruises :: 224 :: 	http://cruises.affordabletours.com/Celebrity_Cruises :: 225 :: 	Holland America Cruises :: 226 :: 	http://cruises.affordabletours.com/Holland_America_Cruises :: 227 :: 	Norwegian Cruises :: 228 :: 	http://cruises.affordabletours.com/Norwegian_Cruises :: 229 :: 	Princess Cruises :: 230 :: 	http://cruises.affordabletours.com/Princess_Cruises :: 231 :: 	Royal Caribbean Cruises :: 232 :: 	http://cruises.affordabletours.com/Royal_Caribbean_Cruises :: 233 :: 	Cunard Cruises :: 234 :: 	http://cruises.affordabletours.com/Cunard_Cruises/ :: 235 :: 	Italy Tours :: 236 :: 	http://www.affordabletours.com/Italy/ :: 237 :: 	Europe tours :: 238 :: 	http://www.affordabletours.com/Europe/ :: 239 :: 	Online Event Registration Management :: 240 :: 	http://www.onlineeventregistrationmanagement.com :: 241 :: 	Copyright @ 2000 - 2011 AllConferences.Com :: 242 ::

Just a few short years ago conventional wisdom predicted large volumes of imported liquefied natural gas would be required to satisfy U.S. gas demand. Such estimates have been turned upside down with predictions of decades of oversupply, thanks in large part to the success of shale gas production. Such tremendous domestic supplies offer a transformational opportunity in American energy planning. :: 159 :: 	Additional Information :: 160 :: 	Team Discount: For teams of three or more from the same organization, the third and subsequent registrants qualify for a 50% discount (applies to Standard registrants onlyy. :: 161 :: <BR/> :: 162 :: <BR/> :: 163 :: 	Home :: 164 :: 	http://www.AllConferences.Com :: 165 :: 	| :: 166 :: 	Submit A Conference :: 167 :: 	http://www.AllConferences.Com/New :: 168 :: 	| :: 169 :: 	Search :: 170 :: 	http://www.AllConferences.Com/Search :: 171 :: 	| :: 172 :: 	Linking Information :: 173 :: 	http://www.AllConferences.Com/link.htm :: 174 :: 	<BR/> :: 175 :: 	Tours :: 176 :: 	http://www.affordabletours.com :: 177 :: 	Cruises :: 178 :: 	http://cruises.affordabletours.com/ :: 179 :: 	River Cruises :: 180 :: 	http://rivers.affordabletours.com/ :: 181 :: 	Resorts :: 182 :: 	http://resorts.affordabletours.com/ :: 183 :: 	Travel Guide :: 184 :: 	http://travelguide.affordabletours.com/ :: 185 :: 	<BR/> :: 186 :: 	Globus Tours :: 187 :: 	http://www.affordabletours.com/Globus_Tours :: 188 :: 	Trafalgar Tours :: 189 :: 	http://www.affordabletours.com/Trafalgar_Tours :: 190 :: 	Insight Tours :: 191 :: 	http://www.affordabletours.com/Insight_Tours :: 192 :: 	Tauck Tours :: 193 :: 	http://www.affordableTours.com/Tauck_Tours :: 194 :: 	Carnival Cruises :: 195 :: 	http://cruises.affordabletours.com/Carnival_Cruises :: 196 :: 	Celebrity Cruises :: 197 :: 	http://cruises.affordabletours.com/Celebrity_Cruises :: 198 :: 	Holland America Cruises :: 199 :: 	http://cruises.affordabletours.com/Holland_America_Cruises :: 200 :: 	Norwegian Cruises :: 201 :: 	http://cruises.affordabletours.com/Norwegian_Cruises :: 202 :: 	Princess Cruises :: 203 :: 	http://cruises.affordabletours.com/Princess_Cruises :: 204 :: 	Royal Caribbean Cruises :: 205 :: 	http://cruises.affordabletours.com/Royal_Caribbean_Cruises :: 206 :: 	Cunard Cruises :: 207 :: 	http://cruises.affordabletours.com/Cunard_Cruises/ :: 208 :: 	Italy Tours :: 209 :: 	http://www.affordabletours.com/Italy/ :: 210 :: 	Europe tours :: 211 :: 	http://www.affordabletours.com/Europe/ :: 212 :: 	Online Event Registration Management :: 213 :: 	http://www.onlineeventregistrationmanagement.com :: 214 :: 	Copyright @ 2000 - 2011 AllConferences.Com :: 215 ::

They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act in the spirit of brotherhood towards one another (Article 1 of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights). Dynamic economic development in the twentieth and the twenty-first century forces us to look for newer and newer areas of exploitation. Production of basic products that are needed for the survival of the humanity is a history now. New technologies constantly heap on mankind with new inventions. Technological innovations are produced so quickly and on such a high scale, that man is not able to enjoy them anymore. Services sector is a new area of economic expansion what is confirmed by development of different forms of tourism, including even space trips. :: 139 :: <BR/> :: 140 :: <BR/> :: 141 :: Finally, the man himself has become the subject of economic exploitation. It has been relatively easily accepted, that in Asian countries, clothes for Europeans are very often made by children. Only few organizations discuss that problem. In many parts of the world, children are used for military purposes, abandoned on the streets. In Europe there are many hidden forms of slavery labor and work without social security. Development of economy is not always consistent with the quoted principle of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the love for neighbor and is reflected in the legal system. In many countries, prostitution, drug trade, euthanasia and abortion have been legalized. Trafficking in people and human organs prospers. Slogans of freedom, equality, liberation are only a justification for such actions and the economic concept of profit at any cost is hidden behind them. :: 142 :: <BR/> :: 143 :: <BR/> :: 144 :: It is worth considering the real intentions of many today's economic activities, especially in the view of cultural collision. Globalization of the world leads inevitably to confrontation between Christian, Islamic, Jewish, secular and other systems of values. However, the most important in all of that is the man. :: 145 :: <BR/> :: 146 :: <BR/> :: 147 :: <BR/> :: 148 :: <BR/> :: 149 :: <BR/> :: 150 :: <BR/> :: 151 :: <BR/> :: 152 :: Abstracts (300-500 words) are due January 31st, 2011.
