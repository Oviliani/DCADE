The comparison of social and epidemiological developments found in different countries makes it possible to disentangle major trends from underlying patterns of alcohol use. This is particularly useful for the development of effective strategies to regulate alcohol use - an aspect which is of great interest in many countries. :: 16 :: <BR/> :: 17 :: <BR/> :: 18 :: The primary purpose of the symposium is to provide a forum where researchers involved in studies on alcohol can exchange ideas about their ongoing research. The scope of the symposium includes studies of determinants and consequences of drinking, drinking practices, attitudes and the social and institutional responses to drinking related harms. Empirical research, theoretical papers and reviews of the literature are welcome. Epidemiology is broadly construed and includes research in a variety of disciplines, such as psychology, sociology, criminology, economics, history and other disciplines. :: 19 :: <BR/> :: 20 :: <BR/> :: 21 :: The Symposium focuses on the discussion of papers that are pre-circulated electronically at this website. Papers are introduced by their author(s) in 10-minute segments, followed by comments from the discussant and general audience participation.

Previous meetings have been highlighted by discussion of topics including: prediction of clinical response to antipsychotic drugs, genes associated with the development of adverse side effects, candidate gene and genome-wide association (GWAS) studies of antidepressant response, the identification of new polymorphisms influencing gene product function, and novel statistical approaches to dissect the heterogeneity of drug response. Moreover, we have brought together investigators working in diverse areas of psychiatric research, from molecular geneticists to clinical trial investigators, from academia and industry, in order to engender true interdisciplinary approaches to the problem of variation in clinical response to psychotropic drugs. It is our hope that each participant will come away from this meeting with an appreciation of the breadth of this emerging field. :: 16 :: <BR/> :: 17 :: <BR/> :: 18 :: <B> Contact: </B> :: 19 :: Katherine Norris :: 20 :: <B> Telephone: </B> :: 21 :: 00 01 718 343-1659 :: 22 :: <B> Email: </B> :: 23 :: Knorris@nshs.edu :: 24 :: mailto:Knorris@nshs.edu :: 25 :: 	<B> Venue: </B> :: 26 :: 	The New York Marriott Downtown :: 27 :: <BR/> :: 28 :: 85 West Street :: 29 :: <BR/> :: 30 :: New York, NY 10006 :: 31 :: <BR/> :: 32 :: 	<B> Website: </B> :: 33 :: 	http://www.pharmacogeneticsinpsychiatry.com/PIP.html :: 34 :: http://www.pharmacogeneticsinpsychiatry.com/PIP.html :: 35 :: 	RDLearning home :: 36 :: 	Default.asp :: 37 :: 	| :: 38 :: 	Research Degrees :: 39 :: 	pages/Default.asp?IsResearch=1&criteria=off :: 40 :: 	| :: 41 :: 	Taught Degrees :: 42 :: 	pages/Default.asp?IsResearch=1&criteria=off :: 43 :: 	| :: 44 :: 	Short Courses :: 45 :: 	Search/allcourses.asp?TrainingTypeID=9&criteria=off :: 46 :: 	| :: 47 :: 	Workshops :: 48 :: 	Search/allcourses.asp?TrainingTypeID=4&criteria=off :: 49 :: 	| :: 50 :: 	Conferences :: 51 :: 	ManageConferences/ListConferences.aspx :: 52 :: 	| :: 53 :: 	Search :: 54 :: 	Search/FreeStandingSearch.asp :: 55 :: 	| :: 56 :: 	Contact us :: 57 :: 	mailto:info@rdinfo.org.uk :: 58 :: 	| Admin page :: 59 :: 	EditLists/Administration.asp :: 60 ::
