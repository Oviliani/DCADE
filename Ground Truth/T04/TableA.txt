A very deep book, and not something to take with you on the beach! One minor point though, re-reading the book today, it seems a little baggy in places, like his other great works, and could benefit from some modern judicial editing maybe.

Due to the length of his historical dialog, there is a temptation to skip past the historical descriptions - don't do so!

There was also a queer triangular, striated marking, about a foot in greatest diameter, which Lake pieced together from three fragments of slate brought up from a deep-blasted aperture. These fragments came from a point to the westward, near the Queen Alexandra Range; and Lake, as a biologist, seemed to find their curious marking unusually puzzling and provocative, though to my geological eye it :: 111 :: Reviews :: 112 :: Add a review for this title. :: 113 :: /reviews/index.php?title_ID=lovecrafthother06At_the_Mountains_of_Madness :: 114 :: Average Rating of :: 115 :: 4.8 :: 116 :: from :: 117 :: 12 :: 118 :: reviews: :: 119 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 120 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 121 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 122 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 123 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 124 :: 2012.09.23 :: 125 :: <BR/> :: 126 :: Sardo Weems :: 127 :: /reviews/filter.php?show=Sardo Weems :: 128 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 129 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 130 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 131 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 132 :: /_resources/images/starg.jpg :: 133 :: A very good introduction to Lovecraft's mythology of the Old Ones and the glories and horrors that preceded humankind and that still linger in places.

L'Abandonn�, like its two companion tales, ran its course as a serial through the Magasin Illustr� of education and recreation, before its issue as a boy's story-book. Its success in both forms seems to have established a record in the race for popularity and a circulation in both the French and English fields of current literature.

If you don't understand Ulysses, you should listen to it on tape; there is an excellent professional version I have heard, but you'd have to listen around for a voice (or voices; the one I heard has a reader, a character voice and also a woman who does Molly in the last chapter). You really are doing yourself a dis-service if you do not dedicate the time to really digesting this book. Granted, a lot of it is a humor that modern Americans who haven't read widely wouldn't find funny, but the wit of the characters (Joyce, in other words) and the incredible, complex, true-to-life depth of the inner workings of thought, of conversation and personalities is so unique. The allusions and the references are not necessary to understand entirely if it's too much for you, but there is no other book like this, no richer, more up-lifting or understanding book than this is literature, period. If you believe a person has to have a PhD to understand or enjoy this, as one worthy gentleman so eloquently put it, I think on the contrary you'd have to be a TV sitcom addict not to see the beauty in this book, let alone to be angry that you couldn't get it . :: 180 :: 2011.11.11 :: 181 :: <BR/> :: 182 :: Stephanie :: 183 :: /reviews/filter.php?show=Stephanie :: 184 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 185 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 186 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 187 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 188 :: /_resources/images/starg.jpg :: 189 :: Oh goodness, folks!

Joyce is so playful and goofy, while at the same time weaving a creation that is dauntingly circular and complex. Even if you thought Dubliners or Portrait of the Artist were a bit dry, you should still give Ulysses a try. Joyce finally put some personality in his writing, and gobs of it.

It is much more occurent in the The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes that Sir Conan Doyle employs the use of Induction, not Deduction, in his main character Sherlock Holmes. The difference is that deduction is drawing two points of fact to draw a conclusion; however, Sherlock Holmes often induces based on fact and experience to surmise conclusions. If you read some of the most famous of Sherlock Holmes quotes, you will notice this pattern. :: 304 :: <BR/> :: 305 :: <BR/> :: 306 :: Thank you, I just needed to point that out.

Public speaking is public utterance, public issuance, of the man himself; therefore the first thing both in time and in importance is that the man should be and think and feel things that are worthy of being given forth. Unless there be something of value within, no tricks of training can ever make of the talker anything more than a machine--albeit a highly perfected machine--for the delivery of other men's goods.

In fact, this is the only vampire story that has ever disturbed my sleep. The old-world language and diary format lend it an air of tension to this novel that is lacking in other vampire books that I have read. Most horror books are scary, but fairly predictable. Not so, Bram Stoker's Dracula. I found this story to be intriguing and enthralling and I found myself unable to put it down.

The heroine, Miss Morris, is a lovable young woman with heaps of common sense, sympathy, wit and humor, so wonderfully and vividly set forth that the reader finds it hard to forgive Carlton for not sooner discovering that he loved her instead of pursuing the Princess Aline in a useless love-chase. Mr. Davis has a teasing way of withholding his secret until the very last moment, but it is easy to forgive him, the result is usually so pleasing. Mr. Davis shows a comprehensive acquaintance with human nature; he has a simple yet sparkling humor in his treatment of subjects, together with a literary grace which places him in a distinct niche, where few if any rivals will be able to reach him. :: 105 :: Show Excerpt :: 106 :: # :: 107 :: very much afraid that she is the one.'

Still I had assured myself that she was not the one.

But, a comprehensive code of false grammar being confessedly the most effectual means of teaching what is true, I have thought fit to supply this portion of my book, not from anonymous or uncertain sources, but from the actual text of other authors, and chiefly from the works of professed grammarians. :: 110 :: In what regards the laws of grammatical purity, says Dr. Campbell, the violation is much more conspicuous than the observance. --See :: 111 :: <EM> Philosophy of Rhetoric </EM> :: 112 :: , p. 190.

I heard Mrs. Inglethorp call Cynthia impatiently, and the girl started and ran back to the house.

Some violent emotion seemed to be mastering him. He looked up at my window as he passed, and I recognized him, though he had changed much in the fifteen years that had elapsed since we last met.

It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.

Of course this is inevitable. A book which has left such a strong and controversial footprint upon the sands of time, and which is only the tip of the iceberg of an intriguing, difficult, and even more controversial system of thought, is bound to produce such a reaction. Personally, as an ardent classical liberal and believer in free-market capitalism, I disagree strongly with the conclusions of this volume; but I am not here to defend my position, and the fact is I believe everyone should read Marx, first for historical insight, but also to be challenged mentally. There is a dangerous tendency in our society only to read books with which one agrees. So-called 'conservatives' read books by 'conservatives' presenting a 'conservative' view on the world; 'liberals' read books by 'liberals' which fit everything within a tidy 'liberal' worldview. Yet this kind of thinking gets one nowhere productive. If I followed this trend, I wouldn't be where I am today. Therefore, rather than either run on a tirade against Marx's views or wax eloquent on his virtues or nitpick his faults, I will simply urge the reader to carefully read and consider what Marx has to say. That is all. One would hope this would be obvious, but judging by other reader responses, that is unfortunately not the case. :: 547 :: 2010.03.02 :: 548 :: <BR/> :: 549 :: James :: 550 :: /reviews/filter.php?show=James :: 551 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 552 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 553 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 554 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 555 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 556 :: people need to remember that this is not a book about an idea that will lead to a select few having absolute control. it is merely a book about a groups utopia. personally, a class less society would be perfect. that way we will no longer be in things such as recession or even depressions. capitalists are just greedy. great book. must read. also, lenin, stalin, etc. are not marxists. they taught their own form of marxism or communism. :: 557 :: 2010.01.25 :: 558 :: <BR/> :: 559 :: Jake Rosenberg :: 560 :: /reviews/filter.php?show=Jake Rosenberg :: 561 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 562 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 563 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 564 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 565 :: /_resources/images/starg.jpg :: 566 :: Larry, in answer to your question, you are absolutely right.

There is nothing new here, surprisingly, perhaps because everything about the downtrodden working class has already done the rounds. George Orwell does a better job of speaking for the proletariat.

The reason America is headed in the same direction now is, the original US Constitution is no longer the rule of law, rather, the US has embraced all 10 planks of the Communist Manifesto. Which is at the root of all its problems. The US needs desperately to return to being the light unto the world for liberty (i.e., man's agency), protection of the individual & family (marriage), private property (in all its forms), which are all God given rights.

Not because everything it said is correct, for we know it is not, but because it offers you a chance to look at the world from a refreshingly different perspective. In this way you will not be too narrow-minded. Much of what it said about capitalism is still true in the developing countries, including rapidly growing ones like China. Seeing the cheap labors toiling in the factories, and seeing how bad the working environment is and how little help and care the workers get, you may understand the authors more, about their compassion, about their ideas. After all, the world market is linked, an so many goods you might be consuming are produced in these factories.

One where the thing happens to the protagonist (Herbert West, Whisperer on the Doorstep, Charles Dexter Ward, Mountains of Madness,) and one where the narrator discovers documents, artifacts, etc. and relates someone else's story. This started out as the latter (boring) type, but luckily it ended with a sailor's first-person account of Cthulhu (pronounced, Smith ).

At first the novel drags on a bit while Austen �sets the stage� of the novel. While Mr. Darcy is immediately assumed to be Elizabeth�s love interest, his absence from a lot of the novel and the introduction of Mr. Collins as a suitor bewildered me and forced me to rethink my assumptions. I enjoyed the many hurdles that Darcy and Elizabeth had to jump over to fall in love with each other. The most hindering hurdle is Elizabeth�s younger sister Lydia. Lydia is immediately introduced as the annoying stereotypical na�ve sister. I enjoyed how her character grew more formidable throughout the novel. While she did become more of a woman, she still retained her childlike stupidity in making adult decisions such as her resolution to run away with Mr. Wickman. This decision affected every character negatively in the novel including Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. I quite enjoyed the novel and subtle humor that Jane Austen portrayed. It was brilliantly integrated into her character�s mannerisms and polite manners. Characters such as Elizabeth and Catherine are able to act snarky without being rude and losing the illusion of social mannerisms. Due to these social expectations of the time period, everything in the novel must be simply assumed. Jane Austen does not come out and directly state what is happening, what characters are truly thinking, or what the characters� dialogues mean. I found this method very obscure and annoying at first, but towards the end of the novel I realized the brilliance of this method of writing. It allows the reader to feel the stifling obscurity of the time. However due to the Victorian diction and the lack of outright plot layout of the novel, some people may find it difficult to read. I personally enjoyed the novel immensely and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a different style of literature or even just a good romance book to read. :: 144 :: 2013.11.02 :: 145 :: <BR/> :: 146 :: Godswill :: 147 :: /reviews/filter.php?show=Godswill :: 148 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 149 :: /_resources/images/starg.jpg :: 150 :: /_resources/images/starg.jpg :: 151 :: /_resources/images/starg.jpg :: 152 :: /_resources/images/starg.jpg :: 153 :: Oh my God!what a wonderful book. :: 154 :: 2013.05.14 :: 155 :: <BR/> :: 156 :: dev :: 157 :: /reviews/filter.php?show=dev :: 158 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 159 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 160 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 161 :: /_resources/images/starg.jpg :: 162 :: /_resources/images/starg.jpg :: 163 :: An interesting love story.Though in the beginning the plot seems a little bit boring,it becomes interesting by the change in views of Darcy and Elizebeth.The most interesting about the book is that it gives a well collection of various natures found in humans. :: 164 :: 2013.03.02 :: 165 :: <BR/> :: 166 :: bhanu :: 167 :: /reviews/filter.php?show=bhanu :: 168 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 169 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 170 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 171 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 172 :: /_resources/images/star.jpg :: 173 :: A beautiful, enlightening love story.

Now I am thoroughly enjoying the book. And I wish I had read it sooner, for it does speak very clearly to my reckless character of the importance and consequences of social address, noting the emotions of others and proper ways of expressing my own. A textbook on style you may call it, but only if you do not observe style as something which belongs to the times past; there is a good deal of immediate benefit to be gained by adding just a touch of manneurism to own conduct.

The protagonist can't decide whether she is angry or happy about turning into a fairy. The dialogue is ponderous and confusing. On many occasions, information is withheld from a character by another for no apparent reason. And just like in a romance novel there are more or less constant descriptions of the protagonist's and other character's bodily responses to their volatile emotions.

I was somewhat surprised and disappointed at the author's portrayal Rae. Gifted with amazing strength and speed, she seems to wilt physically, mentally, and emotionally whenever she encounters an attractive male or is placed under a stressful situation. Reminiscent of the 1950's and earlier cinematic stereotyped portrayals of women - where a good swoon is just around the corner.
