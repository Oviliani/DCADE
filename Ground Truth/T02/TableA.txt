</STRONG> :: 161 :: 	The unexpected pleasure of reading books about databases is that they are often written by authors with highly organised minds. Paul DuBois and his editors at New Riders have assembled :: 162 :: <I> MySQL </I> :: 163 :: with a clarity and lucidity that inspires confidence in the subject matter: a (nearly) freely-re-distributable SQL-interpreting database client-server primarily geared for UNIX systems but maintained for Windows platforms as well. What isn't free about MySQL (the application) is its server's commercial use; all clients and non-commercial server use are free. DuBois's tome isn't free either, but its list price is modest in light of its own and its namesake's value. :: 164 :: The volume is superbly organised in 12 chapters and 10 appendices and contains a concise table of contents and an expansive 50-page index for relational information extraction. It is peppered with references to the on-line HTML documentation that comes with the source and binary distributions (which are available and trivially-installable in stable rpm and tar releases). :: 165 :: The first third of :: 166 :: <I> MySQL </I> :: 167 :: is an excellent instruction tool for database newbies; the second third is a detailed reference for MySQL developers; and the last third consists of clearly annotated appendices, including C, Perl (but not Python), and PHP interfaces. :: 168 :: Perhaps as an indication of the collective will of the developers of MySQL, DuBois does not separate Window 95/98/NT design or development specifics from its main discussions. Platform-independent design is a goal, not a reality, and users will have to rely on newsgroups and mailing lists for details. Moreover, security issues are addressed in a mere 18 pages, a large part of which is devoted to standard UNIX file and network-access permissions. Next-to-nothing is mentioned about defence against common hacking strategies, the use of secure shell interfaces or access encryption. :: 169 :: Although it is nearly 800 pages, DuBois's book is gratefully not encyclopaedic. It is a valuable précis of the MySQL database, and its easy-to-skim look and feel will make it an excellent browse for database experts who want to know what is and is not possible within MySQL, the application. -- :: 170 :: <I> Peter Leopold, Amazon.com </I> :: 171 :: 	Similar Books :: 172 :: 	1-0	MySQL (Developer's Library) Reviews :: 203 :: 	Have you read this book?

Due to the size of the Java 1.2 API, graphics and graphical user interface classes are now examined in a volume called :: 165 :: <I> Java Foundation Classes in a Nutshell </I> :: 166 :: and server-side and enterprise programming are detailed in :: 167 :: <I> Java Enterprise in a Nutshell </I> :: 168 :: . :: 169 :: Though primarily a reference, the book starts off with a thorough, fast-paced introduction to Java, exploring all the key topics including syntax, Object-Oriented programming, security, beans and tools. These discussions are brief and very information-dense but if you are buying this book to learn the language, you will probably be overwhelmed by the speed of this initiation. :: 170 :: This book intends to document quite a bit of Java and it easily succeeds with broad coverage of Java programming in Part I and API cataloguing broken down by package in Part II. For example, discussions in Part I explain types, reflection, and dynamic loading. The handling of these topics takes a little over a page but the book gives a useful overview with code examples that clearly illustrate the points made. It is one of the clearest and most concise treatments of these three topics available. :: 171 :: The chapters in Part II include an introduction, diagrams, and sections for each class in the package. The sections for each class can be very informative, as in the discussion of the Socket class in the java.net chapter, which includes how to instantiate a Socket object, getting I/Ostreams from the object you instantiated, and how to alter the behaviour of sockets. This discussion, like most in this book, is brief, clear and to the point. :: 172 :: If you are looking for a Java reference, this is a solid volume that will provide lasting value. :: 173 :: <I> --John Keogh </I> :: 174 :: <B> Topics covered: </B> :: 175 :: Part I, Introducing Java, provides broad coverage of Java programming topics, including: data types, syntax, classes and objects, Java file structure, inner classes, interfaces, packages, creating and initialising objects, destroying and finalising objects, input/output, cryptography, networking, security, threads, Java Beans, Java Doc and tools that come with Java 1.2 SDK. :: 176 :: Part II, the Java API Quick Reference, includes chapters on the following Java packages: java.beans, java.beans.beancontext, java.io, java.lang, java.lang.ref, java.lang.reflect, java.math, java.net, java.security, java.security.acl, java.security.cert, java.security.interfaces, java.security.spec, java.text, java.util, java.util.jar, java.util.zip, javax.crypto, javax.crypto.interfaces, javax.crypto.spec and a final chapter which provides an index for classes, methods and fields. :: 177 :: 	 	 	Java in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference for Java Programmers Reviews :: 178 :: 	Have you read this book?

The authors also assume use of the Apache Web server, which is by far the most common PHP scenario. Both PHP and MySQL are introduced from scratch, although this is a fast-paced book best suited to at least intermediate developers. :: 158 :: After a brief discussion of Web database applications, the authors offer a rapid tour of PHP essentials, including loops, expressions, functions and common mistakes. Next comes a quick-start guide to MySQL, focusing mainly on the SQL language itself. The following chapters tackle connecting to MySQL and other databases, implementing user-driven queries and enabling writing as well as reading data. There is a useful chapter on data validation, both on the client and the server and excellent coverage of another crucial subject: security and authentication. This looks at the fundamentals of HTTP authentication and examines security features in both Apache and PHP, identifying weaknesses and explaining pros and cons. The closing chapters form a detailed case study, an online wine store, with complete code available for download. It embraces user management, a shopping cart, searching, ordering and delivery, covering many key topics in the process. At the back of the book are appendices on a range of issues, including installation, Web protocols, database modelling and session management. :: 159 :: <I> Web Database Applications </I> :: 160 :: is tightly-focused, packing in lots of solid technical information without wasting words. It does not pretend to cover all the potential uses of PHP, and the screen shots will not win prizes for design, but it's a great handbook for building robust, secure database applications with these popular technologies. -- :: 161 :: <I> Tim Anderson </I> :: 162 :: 	Similar Books :: 163 :: 	1-4	Web Database Applications with PHP, and MySQL Reviews :: 194 :: 	Have you read this book?

Backed up by benchmarks of what works and what doesn't, this book provides some essential wisdom for eliminating some common bottlenecks to Java performance. :: 155 :: The 48 optimisations for various aspects of the Java API make up the heart of this text. Early sections look at a particularly tricky subject--string processing--giving you several techniques for increasing speed and reducing object creation. The in-depth examination of the costs and benefits of string concatenation and the immutability of Java :: 156 :: <I> String </I> :: 157 :: objects will help you uncover possible hot spots that cause lagging performance with strings. :: 158 :: Subsequent sections look at more general strategies for faster programs, like purging obsolete code and the well-known 80-20 rule. (Optimising the 20 percent of your code that consumes 80 percent of processing time, allowing you to create faster software. This book shows you how.) Short tips on such APIs as Java collections and the Java Native Interface (JNI) come next. :: 159 :: The second half of the book zeroes in on better server-side performance with tips on caching and file I/O. The guide to multithreading and synchronisation is a standout here. You'll get several smart tips for speeding up servlets (like pre-computing your standard strings for headers and other boilerplate HTML). The book closes with a valuable custom class for JDBC database connection pooling and a custom HTTP server. Both samples make use of the techniques presented earlier in the text. Even if you don't adopt every suggestion, the ideas here can get you thinking about performance in new ways. (One of the main points of this book is that you can write faster custom code instead of always relying on built-in Java classes and APIs.) :: 160 :: Clearly, Java performance is not something that happens by accident. It must be engineered into your code. This compilation of useful techniques and tips deserves a close look by anyone who wants to squeeze more performance out of Java. :: 161 :: <I> --Richard Dragan, amazon.com </I> :: 162 :: <B> Topics covered: </B> :: 163 :: Introduction to Java performance :: 164 :: More efficient Java string handling (optimising :: 165 :: <I> String </I> :: 166 :: , :: 167 :: <I> String Buffer </I> :: 168 :: , and :: 169 :: <I> String Tokenizer </I> :: 170 :: objects) :: 171 :: Reducing Java overhead :: 172 :: Faster initialisation :: 173 :: The 80-20 rule for optimisation :: 174 :: Getting rid of obsolete code :: 175 :: Speeding up the JDK 1.1 :: 176 :: <I> Vector </I> :: 177 :: and :: 178 :: <I> Hashtable </I> :: 179 :: collection classes :: 180 :: Caching techniques :: 181 :: Optimising file I/O and buffering :: 182 :: Object recycling and object pools :: 183 :: Techniques for multithreading and synchronisation :: 184 :: Amdahl's law and scalability basics :: 185 :: Pros and cons of using the Java Native Interface (JNI) :: 186 :: Hints for optimising Remote Invocation Method (RMI) calls :: 187 :: Performance hints for servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSPs) :: 188 :: Custom sample code for JDBC database connection pooling and a Java HTTP server. :: 189 :: 	 	 	Java Performance and Scalability: 1 (The Sun Microsystems Press Java series) Reviews :: 190 :: 	Have you read this book?

written by authors with highly organised minds. Paul DuBois and his editors at New Riders have assembled :: 161 :: <I> MySQL </I> :: 162 :: with a clarity and lucidity that inspires confidence in the subject matter: a (nearly) freely-re-distributable SQL-interpreting database client-server primarily geared for UNIX systems but maintained for Windows platforms as well. What isn't free about MySQL (the application) is its server's commercial use; all clients and non-commercial server use are free. DuBois's tome isn't free either, but its list price is modest in light of its own and its namesake's value. :: 163 :: The volume is superbly organised in 12 chapters and 10 appendices and contains a concise table of contents and an expansive 50-page index for relational information extraction. It is peppered with references to the on-line HTML documentation that comes with the source and binary distributions (which are available and trivially-installable in stable rpm and tar releases). :: 164 :: The first third of :: 165 :: <I> MySQL </I> :: 166 :: is an excellent instruction tool for database newbies; the second third is a detailed reference for MySQL developers; and the last third consists of clearly annotated appendices, including C, Perl (but not Python), and PHP interfaces. :: 167 :: Perhaps as an indication of the collective will of the developers of MySQL, DuBois does not separate Window 95/98/NT design or development specifics from its main discussions. Platform-independent design is a goal, not a reality, and users will have to rely on newsgroups and mailing lists for details. Moreover, security issues are addressed in a mere 18 pages, a large part of which is devoted to standard UNIX file and network-access permissions. Next-to-nothing is mentioned about defence against common hacking strategies, the use of secure shell interfaces or access encryption. :: 168 :: Although it is nearly 800 pages, DuBois's book is gratefully not encyclopaedic. It is a valuable précis of the MySQL database, and its easy-to-skim look and feel will make it an excellent browse for database experts who want to know what is and is not possible within MySQL, the application. -- :: 169 :: <I> Peter Leopold, Amazon.com </I> :: 170 :: 	Similar Books :: 171 :: 	1-8	MySQL: the Definitive Guide to Using, Programming, and Administering MySQL 4.1 and 5.0 (Developer's Library) Reviews :: 202 :: 	Have you read this book?

Perfect for the intermediate or advanced developer, this book delivers a wealth of information on how to do more with Java. The first sections of this title provide a nicely compact tour of Java basics. If you're a beginner, you'll get a glimpse of the fundamentals of Java quickly. Most of this new edition has the more experienced reader in mind. Subsequent chapters delve into basic and advanced language features of what can be done with classes, interfaces and other design features in Java. The authors' explanations are notably clear and never pedantic. Many examples are illustrated using simple mathematical problems, and the class design samples for inheritance and interfaces all use comprehensible class names and concepts. :: 166 :: This book is just outstanding when it comes to class design. This title will definitely let any reader do more with classes, whether you want to make use of such features as anonymous inner classes , reflection (for loading classes dynamically), or do more with interfaces (including extending interfaces, and even tricks to change data members in interfaces). :: 167 :: Standout sections here include a complete guide to Java language statements, including keywords, literals and support for Unicode. Later sections feature a nicely clear explanation of Java's complicated I/O classes, a fine tutorial on threading and a solid introduction to using Java's collection classes. The book closes with a tour of some additional core Java packages that are available in the language. :: 168 :: In all, this up-to-the-minute guide to some of the more complex features in today's Java fills a valuable niche for any Java developer. Besides providing a glimpse into what the Java team at Sun is up to, this authoritative resource can help you master the finer points of class design, as well as make the most out of newly added features in the new JDK 1.3 standard. :: 169 :: <I> --Richard Dragan, Amazon.com </I> :: 170 :: <B> Topics covered </B> :: 171 :: : Quickstart overview of Java, class and object design in Java, access control, construction and initialisation, static methods, method overloading, class inheritance, redefining members, the :: 172 :: <I> protected </I> :: 173 :: keyword, the :: 174 :: <I> strictfp </I> :: 175 :: keyword and floating point processing, cloning objects, interfaces (constants, methods and modifiers), extending interfaces, marker interfaces, nested classes and interfaces (including static nested types, inner classes and anonymous inner classes), tokens, operators and expressions in Java, literals, keywords, operator precedence, control flow, Java exception handling, exception classes, the :: 176 :: <I> String </I> :: 177 :: and :: 178 :: <I> StringBuffer </I> :: 179 :: classes, threads, synchronisation APIs and techniques (scheduling, thread groups and thread local storage), the wrapper classes for Number types, Java reflection, loading classes, garbage collection (GC algorithms, finalisation and reachability states), packages, JavaDoc documentation tags, tour of Java I/O stream classes, serialisation techniques, new and legacy Java collections, misc. utility classes, system programming with properties, processes and JVM shutdown; internationalisation and localisation techniques, and tour of additional Java core packages. :: 180 :: 	Similar Books :: 181 :: 	1-9	The Java Programming Language (Java Series) Reviews :: 198 :: 	Have you read this book?

Author Sheng Liang built the book around dos and don'ts, even specifying within the introduction when you should and when you should not use JNI. Though sometimes densely written, this title certainly conveys a good deal of technical information on using native code with Java. :: 151 :: After a simple JNI Hello World code example, this book explores multiple aspects of the JNI API, starting with the use of Java strings and arrays within native code. Liang follows by transitioning into calling Java members and methods in C/C++. Here the author presents caching strategies for improving the performance of native code that interacts with or executes Java programs, including a discussion of local and global references that incorporates global weak references in Java 2. :: 152 :: The book also looks at handling exceptions within C/C++ code, as well as tips for working with Java threads. The author shows how to simplify access to C/C++ code through shared stubs and how to use peer classes to encapsulate native code from within Java.

Both Java and XML are cross-platform technologies, so by using Java for code and XML for transporting data, you can build truly portable applications. This title is aimed at intermediate to advanced programmers, and while XML topics are explained more or less from scratch, readers will need prior knowledge of Java. :: 155 :: The book begins with an overview of XML and its uses, and goes on to explain how to parse XML using SAX 2 (the Simple API for XML). Next there is coverage of how XML is validated using DTDs (Document Type Definitions) and XML Schema, and transformed using XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language). Brief coverage of Sun's Java API for XML is followed by a detailed look at JDOM (Java Document Object Model), a new API devised by the author in association with O'Reilly, the publisher. :: 156 :: The last part of the book is more advanced, and covers applications of XML and Java. There are chapters on Web-publishing frameworks, XML RPC (Remote Procedure Calls), using XML to read and write configuration data and generating XML with Java. There is also a short business-to-business example. Appendices provide an API reference to the various specifications discussed in the book. :: 157 :: The strengths of :: 158 :: <I> Java and XML </I> :: 159 :: include the author's deep knowledge of his subject and a writing style that is both clear and enthusiastic. If you happen to know a lot about Java and not much about XML, this is the ideal title. Those who already have a good grasp of XML basics may be frustrated by the amount of introductory material. -- :: 160 :: <I> Tim Anderson </I> :: 161 :: 	 	 	Java and XML (Java Series) Reviews :: 162 :: 	Have you read this book?

How could the combination of this capable pair--which is feature-rich, highly reliable, capable of dealing with large traffic volumes, and absolutely free of charge in most cases--be any better? Take the time to study the advice and work through your own tests of the concepts presented, and it's pretty much certain that you'll walk away with the knowledge you need to do serious development work with the PHP scripting language and the MySQL database server. :: 158 :: Rather than make up trivial programs just to illustrate aspects of the MySQL/PHP environment, this book features code snippets, half a page or so in length each, which illustrate the behaviour of key code structures. For example, in explaining conditional statements in PHP, the book gives you a no-frills IF statement with real values in place. It's not always obvious how the code structures will behave in practice, but the book does a consistently good job of commenting intelligently on the place of each aspect of the language in a well-designed application. The latter half attacks specific problems--a chat system, a guest book, and so on--and walks through the setup of MySQL and each important PHP function for each. :: 159 :: <I> --David Wall </I> :: 160 :: <B> Topics covered: </B> :: 161 :: The PHP server-side scripting language and the MySQL database server, explained for people who have neither a lot of database administration background nor programming experience. Matters of creating and querying databases, and of performing simple and advanced operations with PHP scripting, are covered adroitly. :: 162 :: 	Similar Books :: 163 :: 	1-16	MySQL/PHP Database Applications (M&T Books) Reviews :: 174 :: 	Have you read this book?

JavaServer Pages (JSPs) let you embed server-side Java into Web pages, while also offering full access to other features such as JavaBeans, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), and JDBC database access. The reference JSP implementation is the freely available Apache Tomcat server, so it does not cost anything to get started. All the example code in this book has been tested on Tomcat. :: 164 :: The first part of :: 165 :: <I> JavaServer Pages </I> :: 166 :: covers the essentials of HTTP and Java Servlets, on which JSPs are based. There is also a guide to installing Tomcat on your Windows or Unix system. The next part, which is aimed at Web page designers as well as programmers, covers JSP application development. There are chapters on scripting elements, error handling, managing user sessions, database access, security, and the use of XML and XSL with JSP. Part III is for programmers, and broadens the scope to include EJB and other Java components, developing custom tags, and achieving highly scaleable applications using database connection pools. The book concludes with a comprehensive reference section. :: 167 :: The author has been an active participant in the official Servlet and JSP working groups, and his book is both well informed and well organised. It provides experts with invaluable tips and insights, while newcomers will find all they need to assess and implement their first JSP applications. -- :: 168 :: <I> Tim Anderson </I> :: 169 :: 	 	 	Java Server Pages (Java Series) Reviews :: 170 :: 	Have you read this book?

If anything can go wrong, it will. When it comes to today's enterprise-level, multi-tiered applications written in Java, there's a lot more that can go wrong in regard to performance. Written by two experts in enterprise Java (both veterans of IBM's SanFrancisco Java class frameworks), :: 156 :: <I> Enterprise Java Performance </I> :: 157 :: examines performance from beyond a single workstation. Filled with useful insights for designing Java applications on multiple servers, this book offers a timely and very useful guide suitable for any intermediate to advanced Java programmer. :: 158 :: While there are a number of titles on Java performance, this one stands out because of its enterprise-level perspective. Of course, you'll find some hints for writing better Java code at the micro level (which the authors call low-hanging fruit ) with hints for optimising string and loop performance. But this is just the beginning. :: 159 :: The heart of the book is its thorough discussion of performance and design issues for using remote objects, which allow distributed applications to do their work on multiple servers. The authors delve first into the issues of object design, including the correct granularity of objects. Examples drawn from the authors' experience designing IBM's San Francisco application framework lends more credence to the discussion. The performance issues surrounding the cross-vendor Enterprise JavaBean (EJB) standard are also examined. :: 160 :: Besides describing performance issues in enterprise applications, the book also gives you a number of tools to measure performance in your own code, including custom classes for performance monitoring, as well as the authors' enterprise-level benchmark--Business Object Benchmark (BOB). Later chapters include a succinct taxonomy of application styles for Java, such as Web-based clients or applications that wrap legacy systems. Performance hints are offered for each. There is also an excellent guide to running CORBA on Java and plenty of hints for optimising servers, including memory configuration. A final chapter glances at performance issues with clustered servers. :: 161 :: In all, :: 162 :: <I> Enterprise Java Performance </I> :: 163 :: offers a valuable perspective on issues that all Java developers will likely face when creating distributed applications.

The book begins with a fine introduction to databases that covers tables, fields, indexes and normalisation. Then it explains the history of the freeware MySQL and mSQL packages which offer better performance than commercial relational database management system (RDBMS) packages although they don't support transactions or other features. Next the authors look at SQL as used within MySQL and mSQL and clarify where to download these packages and how to install them. Examples of how to programme with MySQL/mSQL in C/C++ follow. :: 161 :: One of the best parts of this book is its introduction to using Common Gateway Interface (CGI) and Perl to power a Web site with a MySQL/mSQL database. This section offers complete information on using mSQL Perl--and the emerging Database Independent (DBI) standard--for developing CGI database scripts in Perl and includes clear examples (including a student database). The book then moves from Perl on to other programming languages such as Python and Java. Reference material to all the relevant APIs is featured for each language. :: 162 :: Whatever programming API you choose MySQL and mSQL are ready to meet the needs of the small- to moderate-size Web site. This book delivers essential information on these packages and will help both Web masters and programmers get the most out of these powerful freeware database tools. -- :: 163 :: <I> Richard Dragan </I> :: 164 :: 	Similar Books :: 165 :: 	1-28	MySQL & mSQL Reviews :: 176 :: 	Have you read this book?
