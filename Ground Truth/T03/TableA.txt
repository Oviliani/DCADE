You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study. :: 460 :: 	<BR/> :: 461 :: 	The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. :: 462 :: <BR/> :: 463 :: That's how your brain knows. :: 464 :: <BR/> :: 465 :: And that's how your brain will learn Java. Head First Java combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java. You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI. And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform. Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required. So learning the Head First way is more important than ever. :: 466 :: <BR/> :: 467 :: If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read. :: 468 :: <BR/> :: 469 :: By exploiting how your brain works, Head First Java compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information. Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book. But if you want to understand Java, this book's for you. :: 470 :: 	Product Details :: 471 :: 	Media: Paperback Book, 688 pages :: 472 :: 	Publisher: O'Reilly Media (Feb. 28th, 2005) :: 473 :: 	ISBN-10: 0596009208 :: 474 :: 	ISBN-13: 9780596009205 :: 475 :: 	Dimensions: 8.00 x 9.29 x 1.49 inches :: 476 :: 	Shipping Weight: 2.86 lbs :: 477 :: 	 	Product Categories :: 478 :: 	Java :: 479 :: java-books-H1010.aspx :: 480 :: You might like these titles in Java :: 481 :: $35.48 USED :: 482 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/189/Murach-s-Java-SE-6-9781890774424-sm.jpg :: 483 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Murach's-Java-SE-6-id-1890774421.aspx :: 484 :: Murach's Java SE 6 :: 485 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Murach's-Java-SE-6-id-1890774421.aspx :: 486 :: Murach, Joel / Steelman, Andrea :: 487 :: $25.98 USED :: 488 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/059/Head-First-Java-Sierra-Kathy-9780596009205-sm.jpg :: 489 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Head-First-Java-id-0596009208.aspx :: 490 :: Head First Java :: 491 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Head-First-Java-id-0596009208.aspx :: 492 :: Sierra, Kathy / Bates, Bert :: 493 :: $30.48 NEW :: 494 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/067/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Java-in-24-Hours-9780672330766-sm.jpg :: 495 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Java-in-24-Hours-id-0672330768.aspx :: 496 :: Sams Teach Yourself Java in 24 Hours :: 497 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Java-in-24-Hours-id-0672330768.aspx :: 498 :: Cadenhead, Rogers :: 499 :: Head First Java - 2nd Edition Reviews :: 500 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com:80//head-first-java-2nd-edition-id-0596009208.aspimages/ratings/stars/Stars5of5.gif :: 501 :: <STRONG> 5 out of 5 </STRONG> :: 502 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com:80//head-first-java-2nd-edition-id-0596009208.aspimages/Goodreads/goodreads_logo_110.gif :: 503 :: http://www.goodreads.com/ :: 504 :: <BR/> :: 505 :: <STRONG> by </STRONG> :: 506 :: Allisonperkel :: 507 :: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/231262.Head_First_Java_2nd_Edition :: 508 :: <STRONG> from Somerville, MA | Dec 12, 2009 </STRONG> :: 509 :: <BR/> :: 510 :: I'm a fairly well versed programmer in some of the older style languages like C and C++.

It's used to create and maintain database objects, place data into those objects, query the data, modify the data, and, finally, delete data that is no longer needed. Databases lie at the heart of many, if not most business applications. Chances are very good that if you're involved with software development, you're using SQL to some degree. And if you're using SQL, you should own a good reference or two. :: 363 :: Now available in an updated second edition, our very popular SQL Pocket Guide is a major help to programmers, database administrators, and everyone who uses SQL in their day-to-day work. The SQL Pocket Guide is a concise reference to frequently used SQL statements and commonly used SQL functions. Not just an endless collection of syntax diagrams, this portable guide addresses the language's complexity head on and leads by example. The information in this edition has been updated to reflect the latest versions of the most commonly used SQL variants including: Oracle Database 10g, Release 2 (including the free Oracle Database 10g Express Edition (XE)) Microsoft SQL Server 2005 MySQL 5 IBM DB2 8.2 PostreSQL 8.1 database :: 364 :: 	Product Details :: 365 :: 	Media: Paperback Book, 184 pages :: 366 :: 	Publisher: O'Reilly Media (Apr. 30th, 2006) :: 367 :: 	ISBN-10: 0596526881 :: 368 :: 	ISBN-13: 9780596526887 :: 369 :: 	Dimensions: 4.28 x 7.02 x 0.53 inches :: 370 :: 	Shipping Weight: 0.37 lbs :: 371 :: 	 	Product Categories :: 372 :: 	SQL :: 373 :: sql-books-H1022.aspx :: 374 :: You might like these titles in SQL :: 375 :: $5.48 USED :: 376 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/059/SQL-Pocket-Guide-9780596526887-sm.jpg :: 377 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/SQL-Pocket-Guide-id-0596526881.aspx :: 378 :: SQL Pocket Guide: :: 379 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/SQL-Pocket-Guide-id-0596526881.aspx :: 380 :: Gennick, Jonathan :: 381 :: $26.98 NEW :: 382 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/193/SQL-Antipatterns-Karwin-Bill-9781934356555-sm.jpg :: 383 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/SQL-Antipatterns-Avoiding-the-Pitfalls-of-Database-Programming-id-1934356557.aspx :: 384 :: SQL Antipatterns: Avoiding the Pitfalls of Database Programming :: 385 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/SQL-Antipatterns-Avoiding-the-Pitfalls-of-Database-Programming-id-1934356557.aspx :: 386 :: Karwin, Bill :: 387 :: $5.48 USED :: 388 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/067/PHP-and-MySQL-Web-Development-9780672326721-sm.jpg :: 389 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/PHP-and-MySQL-Web-Development-id-0672326728.aspx :: 390 :: PHP and MySQL Web Development :: 391 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/PHP-and-MySQL-Web-Development-id-0672326728.aspx :: 392 :: Welling, Luke / Thomson, Laura :: 393 :: SQL Pocket Guide Reviews :: 394 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com:80//sql-pocket-guide-id-0596526881.aspimages/ratings/stars/Stars4of5.gif :: 395 :: <STRONG> 4 out of 5 </STRONG> :: 396 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com:80//sql-pocket-guide-id-0596526881.aspimages/Goodreads/goodreads_logo_110.gif :: 397 :: http://www.goodreads.com/ :: 398 :: <BR/> :: 399 :: <STRONG> by </STRONG> :: 400 :: Sarah :: 401 :: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/425243.SQL_Pocket_Guide :: 402 :: <STRONG> from Minneapolis, MN | Apr 23, 2010 </STRONG> :: 403 :: <BR/> :: 404 :: it was a good reference for someone that didn't know much of SQL at the time.

A writer in tune with the reading habits and tastes of modern readers, Sandra understands the time constraints of most women. With these concerns in mind, Sandra has adapted this study on Judges in such a convenient way that it can be read during brief lulls in our daily schedules that present opportunities for meditation and study (breakfast, lunch, coffee breaks, etc.). :: 362 :: 	Product Details :: 363 :: 	Media: Spiral Book, 144 pages :: 364 :: 	Publisher: AMG Publishers (Mar. 31st, 2006) :: 365 :: 	ISBN-10: 0899572219 :: 366 :: 	ISBN-13: 9780899572215 :: 367 :: 	Dimensions: 6.06 x 8.56 x 0.43 inches :: 368 :: 	Shipping Weight: 0.46 lbs :: 369 :: 	 	Product Categories :: 370 :: 	Old Testament Bible Studies :: 371 :: old-testament-bible-studies-books-H4476.aspx :: 372 :: You might like these titles in Old Testament Bible Studies :: 373 :: $10.98 NEW :: 374 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com:80/images/products/noimage_results.jpg :: 375 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Genesis-Commentary-Notes-Study-Questions-id-1586174339.aspx :: 376 :: Genesis: Commentary, Notes, & Study Questions :: 377 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Genesis-Commentary-Notes-Study-Questions-id-1586174339.aspx :: 378 :: Walters, Dennis / Hahn, Scott / Mitch, Curtis :: 379 :: $20.48 NEW :: 380 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/039/The-Book-of-Genesis-Crumb-R-9780393061024-sm.jpg :: 381 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/The-Book-of-Genesis-id-0393061027.aspx :: 382 :: The Book of Genesis :: 383 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/The-Book-of-Genesis-id-0393061027.aspx :: 384 :: Crumb, R. :: 385 :: $16.48 USED :: 386 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/082/Tanakh-9780827603660-sm.jpg :: 387 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Tanakh-id-0827603665.aspx :: 388 :: Tanakh :: 389 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Tanakh-id-0827603665.aspx :: 390 :: Jewish Publication Society of America :: 391 :: Java with the Judges Reviews :: 392 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com:80//java-with-the-judges-id-0899572219.aspimages/ratings/stars/Stars2of5.gif :: 393 :: <STRONG> 2 out of 5 </STRONG> :: 394 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com:80//java-with-the-judges-id-0899572219.aspimages/Goodreads/goodreads_logo_110.gif :: 395 :: http://www.goodreads.com/ :: 396 :: <BR/> :: 397 :: <STRONG> by </STRONG> :: 398 :: Michelle :: 399 :: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1374321.Java_With_the_Judges :: 400 :: <STRONG> from Osler, SK, Canada | Nov 1, 2010 </STRONG> :: 401 :: <BR/> :: 402 :: Easy basic study.

It's the secretive, Pentagon-led agency known as DARPA. Founded by Eisenhower in response to Sputnik and the Soviet space program, DARPA mixes military officers with sneaker-wearing scientists, seeking paradigm-shifting ideas in varied fields--from energy, robotics, and rockets to peopleless operating rooms, driverless cars, and planes that can fly halfway around the world in just hours. DARPA gave birth to the Internet, GPS, and mind-controlled robotic arms. Its geniuses define future technology for the military and the rest of us. :: 470 :: Michael Belfiore was given unprecedented access to write this first-ever popular account of DARPA. Visiting research sites across the country, he watched scientists in action and talked to the creative, fearlessly ambitious visionaries working for and with DARPA. Much of DARPA's work is classified, and this book is full of material that has barely been reported in the general media. In fact, DARPA estimates that only 2 percent of Americans know much of anything about the agency.

And now, with the release of the 5.0 version of Java, O'Reilly has given the book that defined the in a Nutshell category another impressive tune-up. :: 439 :: In this latest revision, readers will find Java in a Nutshell, 5th Edition, does more than just cover the extensive changes implicit in 5.0, the newest version of Java. It's undergone a complete makeover--in scope, size, and type of coverage--in order to more closely meet the needs of the modern Java programmer. :: 440 :: 	 	To wit, Java in a Nutshell, 5th Edition now places less emphasis on coming to Java from C and C++, and adds more discussion on tools and frameworks. It also offers new code examples to illustrate the working of APIs, and, of course, extensive coverage of Java 5.0. But faithful readers take comfort: it still hasn't lost any of its core elements that made it such a classic to begin with. :: 441 :: This handy reference gets right to the heart of the program with an accelerated introduction to the Java programming language and its key APIs--ideal for developers wishing to start writing code right away. And, as was the case in previous editions, Java in a Nutshell, 5th Edition is once again chock-full of poignant tips, techniques, examples, and practical advice. For as long as Java has existed, Java in a Nutshell has helped developers maximize the capabilities of the program's newest versions. And this latest edition is no different. :: 442 :: 	Product Details :: 443 :: 	Media: Paperback Book, 1224 pages :: 444 :: 	Publisher: O'Reilly Media (Mar. 31st, 2005) :: 445 :: 	ISBN-10: 0596007736 :: 446 :: 	ISBN-13: 9780596007737 :: 447 :: 	Dimensions: 6.26 x 9.16 x 2.21 inches :: 448 :: 	Shipping Weight: 3.26 lbs :: 449 :: 	 	Product Categories :: 450 :: 	Java :: 451 :: java-books-H1010.aspx :: 452 :: You might like these titles in Java :: 453 :: $35.48 USED :: 454 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/189/Murach-s-Java-SE-6-9781890774424-sm.jpg :: 455 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Murach's-Java-SE-6-id-1890774421.aspx :: 456 :: Murach's Java SE 6 :: 457 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Murach's-Java-SE-6-id-1890774421.aspx :: 458 :: Murach, Joel / Steelman, Andrea :: 459 :: $25.98 USED :: 460 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/059/Head-First-Java-Sierra-Kathy-9780596009205-sm.jpg :: 461 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Head-First-Java-id-0596009208.aspx :: 462 :: Head First Java :: 463 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Head-First-Java-id-0596009208.aspx :: 464 :: Sierra, Kathy / Bates, Bert :: 465 :: $30.48 NEW :: 466 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/067/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Java-in-24-Hours-9780672330766-sm.jpg :: 467 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Java-in-24-Hours-id-0672330768.aspx :: 468 :: Sams Teach Yourself Java in 24 Hours :: 469 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Java-in-24-Hours-id-0672330768.aspx :: 470 :: Cadenhead, Rogers :: 471 :: Java in a Nutshell Reviews :: 472 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com:80//java-in-a-nutshell-id-0596007736.aspimages/ratings/stars/Stars4of5.gif :: 473 :: <STRONG> 4 out of 5 </STRONG> :: 474 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com:80//java-in-a-nutshell-id-0596007736.aspimages/Goodreads/goodreads_logo_110.gif :: 475 :: http://www.goodreads.com/ :: 476 :: <BR/> :: 477 :: <STRONG> by </STRONG> :: 478 :: Nivas :: 479 :: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/231264.Java_In_A_Nutshell_5th_Edition :: 480 :: <STRONG> from The United States | Feb 17, 2010 </STRONG> :: 481 :: <BR/> :: 482 :: Good book for someone looking for details on Java programming methods.

To start, this book presents the essential SQL statements for retrieving and updating the data in a database, because that's what every application developer needs to know. Then, it shows you how to design and create a database, because application developers often end up in the role of database designer and DBA. Next, it shows how to work with views, scripts, stored procedures, functions, triggers, cursors, transactions, locking, security, XML data, and BLOB data with FILESTREAM storage. These features allow you to create database applications that are thoroughly professional. Finally, this book shows how to use the CLR integration feature, so you can use C# or Visual Basic to code stored procedures, functions, triggers, aggregate functions, and user-defined types. :: 438 :: 	 	 	Product Details :: 439 :: 	Media: Paperback Book, 778 pages :: 440 :: 	Publisher: Mike Murach & Associates (Dec. 31st, 2008) :: 441 :: 	ISBN-10: 1890774510 :: 442 :: 	ISBN-13: 9781890774516 :: 443 :: 	Dimensions: 8.05 x 9.97 x 1.40 inches :: 444 :: 	Shipping Weight: 3.39 lbs :: 445 :: 	 	Product Categories :: 446 :: 	SQL Server :: 447 :: sql-server-books-H902.aspx :: 448 :: You might like these titles in SQL Server :: 449 :: $35.48 USED :: 450 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/189/Murach-s-SQL-Server-2008-for-Developers-9781890774516-sm.jpg :: 451 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Murach's-SQL-Server-2008-for-Developers-Training-Reference-id-1890774510.aspx :: 452 :: Murach's SQL Server 2008 for Developers: Training & Reference :: 453 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Murach's-SQL-Server-2008-for-Developers-Training-Reference-id-1890774510.aspx :: 454 :: Syverson, Bryan / Murach, Joel :: 455 :: $42.98 NEW :: 456 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/067/Microsoft-SQL-Server-2008-Unleashed-9780672330568-sm.jpg :: 457 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Microsoft-SQL-Server-2008-R2-Unleashed-With-CDROM-id-0672330563.aspx :: 458 :: Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 Unleashed [With CDROM] :: 459 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Microsoft-SQL-Server-2008-R2-Unleashed-With-CDROM-id-0672330563.aspx :: 460 :: Rankins, Ray / Bertucci, Paul / Gallelli, Chris :: 461 :: $36.98 NEW :: 462 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/073/Microsoft-SQL-Server-2008-Reporting-Services-Step-by-Step-9780735626478-sm.jpg :: 463 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Microsoft-SQL-Server-2008-Reporting-Services-Step-by-Step-id-0735626472.aspx :: 464 :: Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Reporting Services Step by Step :: 465 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Microsoft-SQL-Server-2008-Reporting-Services-Step-by-Step-id-0735626472.aspx :: 466 :: Misner, Stacia :: 467 :: Murach's SQL Server 2008 for Developers Reviews :: 468 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com:80//murach's-sql-server-2008-for-developers-id-1890774510.aspimages/ratings/stars/Stars2of5.gif :: 469 :: <STRONG> 2 out of 5 </STRONG> :: 470 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com:80//murach's-sql-server-2008-for-developers-id-1890774510.aspimages/Goodreads/goodreads_logo_110.gif :: 471 :: http://www.goodreads.com/ :: 472 :: <BR/> :: 473 :: <STRONG> by </STRONG> :: 474 :: Janet :: 475 :: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6294896-murach-s-sql-server-2008-for-developers :: 476 :: <STRONG> from Preston, WA | Oct 9, 2010 </STRONG> :: 477 :: <BR/> :: 478 :: I am not happy with Murach textbooks, and find I always have to learn about things by going outside the book. :: 479 :: <BR/> :: 480 :: <BR/> :: 481 :: Textbook for SQL class.

Hibernate, the most popular Java persistence tool, provides automatic and transparent object/relational mapping making it a snap to work with SQL databases in Java applications. Hibernate applications are cheaper, more portable, and more resilient to change. Because it conforms to the new EJB 3.0 and Java Persistence 1.0 standard, Hibernate allows the developer to seamlessly create efficient, scalable Java EE applications. :: 483 :: Java Persistence with Hibernate explores Hibernate by developing an application that ties together hundreds of individual examples. You'll immediately dig into the rich programming model of Hibernate 3.2 and Java Persistence, working through queries, fetching strategies, caching, transactions, conversations, and more. You'll also appreciate the well-illustrated discussion of best practices in database design, object/relational mapping, and optimization techniques. :: 484 :: 	 	In this revised edition of the bestselling Hibernate in Action, authors Christian Bauer and Gavin King-the founder of the Hibernate project-cover Hibernate 3.2 in detail along with the EJB 3.0 and Java Persistence standard. :: 485 :: 	Product Details :: 486 :: 	Media: Paperback Book, 841 pages :: 487 :: 	Publisher: Manning Publications (Dec. 31st, 2006) :: 488 :: 	ISBN-10: 1932394885 :: 489 :: 	ISBN-13: 9781932394887 :: 490 :: 	Dimensions: 7.15 x 9.45 x 1.80 inches :: 491 :: 	Shipping Weight: 3.19 lbs :: 492 :: 	 	Product Categories :: 493 :: 	Java :: 494 :: java-books-H1010.aspx :: 495 :: You might like these titles in Java :: 496 :: $35.48 USED :: 497 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/189/Murach-s-Java-SE-6-9781890774424-sm.jpg :: 498 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Murach's-Java-SE-6-id-1890774421.aspx :: 499 :: Murach's Java SE 6 :: 500 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Murach's-Java-SE-6-id-1890774421.aspx :: 501 :: Murach, Joel / Steelman, Andrea :: 502 :: $23.98 USED :: 503 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/059/Head-First-Java-Sierra-Kathy-9780596009205-sm.jpg :: 504 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Head-First-Java-id-0596009208.aspx :: 505 :: Head First Java :: 506 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Head-First-Java-id-0596009208.aspx :: 507 :: Sierra, Kathy / Bates, Bert :: 508 :: $30.48 NEW :: 509 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/067/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Java-in-24-Hours-9780672330766-sm.jpg :: 510 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Java-in-24-Hours-id-0672330768.aspx :: 511 :: Sams Teach Yourself Java in 24 Hours :: 512 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Java-in-24-Hours-id-0672330768.aspx :: 513 :: Cadenhead, Rogers :: 514 :: Java Persistence with Hibernate Reviews :: 515 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com:80//java-persistence-with-hibernate-id-1932394885.aspimages/ratings/stars/Stars3of5.gif :: 516 :: <STRONG> 3 out of 5 </STRONG> :: 517 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com:80//java-persistence-with-hibernate-id-1932394885.aspimages/Goodreads/goodreads_logo_110.gif :: 518 :: http://www.goodreads.com/ :: 519 :: <BR/> :: 520 :: <STRONG> by </STRONG> :: 521 :: John :: 522 :: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/231267.Java_Persistence_with_Hibernate :: 523 :: <STRONG> from Minneapolis, MN | Jul 9, 2010 </STRONG> :: 524 :: <BR/> :: 525 :: This book is a bit wordy to read straight through, but it makes an adequate reference.

As seasoned author Wallace Wang explains, hacking can also mean questioning the status quo, looking for your own truths, and never accepting at face value anything authorities say or do. :: 399 :: The completely revised fourth edition of this offbeat, non-technical book examines what hackers do, how they do it, and how you can protect yourself. Written in the same informative, irreverent, and entertaining style that made the first three editions hugely successful, Steal This Computer Book 4.0 will expand your mind and raise your eyebrows. New chapters discuss the hacker mentality, social engineering and lock picking, exploiting P2P file-sharing networks, and how people manipulate search engines and pop-up ads to obtain and use personal information. Wang also takes issue with the media for hacking the news and presenting the public with self-serving stories of questionable accuracy. Inside, you'll discover: :: 400 :: 	 	How to manage and fight spam and spyware How Trojan horse programs and rootkits work, and how to defend against them How hackers steal software and defeat copy-protection mechanisms How to tell if your machine is being attacked and what you can do to protect it Where the hackers are, how they probe a target and sneak into a computer, and what they do once they get inside How corporations use hacker techniques to infect your computer and invade your privacy How you can lock down your computer to protect your data and your personal information using free programs included on the book's CD If you ve ever logged onto awebsite, conducted an online transaction, sent or received email, used a networked computer, or even watched the evening news, you may have already been tricked, tracked, hacked, and manipulated. As the saying goes, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you. And, as Wallace Wang reveals, they probably are. The companion CD contains hundreds of megabytes of 100% FREE hacking and security-related programs, like keyloggers, spyware stoppers, port blockers, IP scanners, Trojan horse detectors, and much, much more.

An enormous indoor ski slope attracts shoppers to a mall in Dubai; an uber luxurious Sao Paolo department store provides its customers with personal shoppers; a mall in South Africa has a wave pool for surfing. :: 463 :: The new Why We Buy is an essential guide -- it offers advice on how to keep your changing customers and entice new and eager ones. :: 464 :: 	Product Details :: 465 :: 	Media: Paperback Book, 306 pages :: 466 :: 	Publisher: Simon & Schuster (Dec. 31st, 2008) :: 467 :: 	ISBN-10: 1416595244 :: 468 :: 	ISBN-13: 9781416595243 :: 469 :: 	Dimensions: 5.40 x 8.30 x 0.90 inches :: 470 :: 	Shipping Weight: 0.65 lbs :: 471 :: 	 	Product Categories :: 472 :: 	Marketing Research :: 473 :: marketing-research-books-H754.aspx :: 474 :: Cultural Anthropology :: 475 :: cultural-anthropology-books-H4873.aspx :: 476 :: You might like these titles in Marketing Research :: 477 :: $9.48 USED :: 478 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/141/Why-We-Buy-The-Science-of-Shopping-9781416595243-sm.jpg :: 479 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Why-We-Buy-The-Science-of-Shopping-Updated-and-Revised-for-the-Internet-the-Global-Consumer-and-id-1416595244.aspx :: 480 :: Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping: Updated and Revised for the Internet, the Global Consumer, and Beyond :: 481 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Why-We-Buy-The-Science-of-Shopping-Updated-and-Revised-for-the-Internet-the-Global-Consumer-and-id-1416595244.aspx :: 482 :: Underhill, Paco :: 483 :: $20.48 NEW :: 484 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/044/Unthinking-Beckwith-Harry-9780446564144-sm.jpg :: 485 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Unthinking-The-Surprising-Forces-Behind-What-We-Buy-id-0446564141.aspx :: 486 :: Unthinking: The Surprising Forces Behind What We Buy :: 487 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Unthinking-The-Surprising-Forces-Behind-What-We-Buy-id-0446564141.aspx :: 488 :: Beckwith, Harry :: 489 :: $12.09 USED :: 490 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/038/Buyology-9780385523899-sm.jpg :: 491 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Buyology-Truth-and-Lies-about-Why-We-Buy-id-0385523890.aspx :: 492 :: Buyology: Truth and Lies about Why We Buy :: 493 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/Buyology-Truth-and-Lies-about-Why-We-Buy-id-0385523890.aspx :: 494 :: Lindstrom, Martin / Underhill, Paco :: 495 :: Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping Reviews :: 496 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com:80//why-we-buy-the-science-of-shopping-id-1416595244.aspimages/ratings/stars/Stars1of5.gif :: 497 :: <STRONG> 1 out of 5 </STRONG> :: 498 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com:80//why-we-buy-the-science-of-shopping-id-1416595244.aspimages/Goodreads/goodreads_logo_110.gif :: 499 :: http://www.goodreads.com/ :: 500 :: <BR/> :: 501 :: <STRONG> by </STRONG> :: 502 :: Wayne :: 503 :: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3721283.Why_We_Buy :: 504 :: <STRONG> from New Orleans, LA | Jul 1, 2007 </STRONG> :: 505 :: <BR/> :: 506 :: Rather disappointing -- it reads like a book length sales brochure for Envirosell, the company the author founded.

Indeed, that's what computers are for. You can enlist your own computer to automate all of your project's repetitive tasks, ranging from individual builds and running unit tests through to full product release, customer deployment, and monitoring the system. :: 483 :: Many teams try to do these tasks by hand. That's usually a really bad idea: people just aren't as good at repetitive tasks as machines. You run the risk of doing it differently the one time it matters, on one machine but not another, or doing it just plain wrong.

They can provide you with a wealth of information on how your queries are being executed by SQL Server, including: Which indexes are being used, and where no indexes are being used at all. How the data is being retrieved, and joined, from the tables defi ned in your query. How aggregations in GROUP BY queries are put together. The anticipated load and the estimated cost that all these operations place upon the system. Grant Fritchey's book is the only in-depth look at how to improve your SQL query performance through careful design of execution plans. Sample chapters of the ebook have garnered stunning reviews, such as: All I can say is WOW. This has to be the best reference I have ever seen on Execution Plans in SQL Server. My hats off to Grant Fritchey Jonathan Kehayias. :: 348 :: 	Product Details :: 349 :: 	Media: Paperback Book, 250 pages :: 350 :: 	Publisher: Simple Talk Publishing (Mar. 31st, 2009) :: 351 :: 	ISBN-10: 1906434026 :: 352 :: 	ISBN-13: 9781906434021 :: 353 :: 	Dimensions: 9.21 x 6.14 x 0.53 inches :: 354 :: 	Shipping Weight: 0.78 lbs :: 355 :: 	 	Product Categories :: 356 :: 	SQL :: 357 :: sql-books-H1022.aspx :: 358 :: You might like these titles in SQL :: 359 :: $5.48 USED :: 360 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/059/SQL-Pocket-Guide-9780596526887-sm.jpg :: 361 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/SQL-Pocket-Guide-id-0596526881.aspx :: 362 :: SQL Pocket Guide: :: 363 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/SQL-Pocket-Guide-id-0596526881.aspx :: 364 :: Gennick, Jonathan :: 365 :: $26.98 NEW :: 366 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/193/SQL-Antipatterns-Karwin-Bill-9781934356555-sm.jpg :: 367 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/SQL-Antipatterns-Avoiding-the-Pitfalls-of-Database-Programming-id-1934356557.aspx :: 368 :: SQL Antipatterns: Avoiding the Pitfalls of Database Programming :: 369 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/SQL-Antipatterns-Avoiding-the-Pitfalls-of-Database-Programming-id-1934356557.aspx :: 370 :: Karwin, Bill :: 371 :: $5.48 USED :: 372 :: http://images.betterworldbooks.com/067/PHP-and-MySQL-Web-Development-9780672326721-sm.jpg :: 373 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/PHP-and-MySQL-Web-Development-id-0672326728.aspx :: 374 :: PHP and MySQL Web Development :: 375 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com/PHP-and-MySQL-Web-Development-id-0672326728.aspx :: 376 :: Welling, Luke / Thomson, Laura :: 377 :: SQL Server Execution Plans Reviews :: 378 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com:80//sql-server-execution-plans-id-1906434026.aspimages/ratings/stars/Stars5of5.gif :: 379 :: <STRONG> 5 out of 5 </STRONG> :: 380 :: http://www.betterworldbooks.com:80//sql-server-execution-plans-id-1906434026.aspimages/Goodreads/goodreads_logo_110.gif :: 381 :: http://www.goodreads.com/ :: 382 :: <BR/> :: 383 :: <STRONG> by </STRONG> :: 384 :: Eric :: 385 :: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3357028.Dissecting_SQL_Server_Execution_Plans :: 386 :: <STRONG> from Jacksonville, FL | Jan 10, 2010 </STRONG> :: 387 :: <BR/> :: 388 :: This book was an easy read on a subject that can be relatively intimidating for a developer with no experience in the area.
