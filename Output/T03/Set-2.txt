You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study. The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. That's how your brain knows. And that's how your brain will learn Java. Head First Java combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and its effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java. You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI. And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform. Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required. So learning the Head First way is more important than ever. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read. By exploiting how your brain works, Head First Java compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information. Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book. But if you want to understand Java, this book's for you. :: 368 :: 	<BR/> :: 369 :: 	<STRONG> Ships from The Book Depository, CA, </STRONG> :: 370 :: 	USA :: 371 ::

Java Web Services: Up and Running takes a clear, no-nonsense approach to these technologies by providing you with a mix of architectural overview, complete working code examples, and short yet precise instructions for compiling, deploying, and executing a sample application. You'll not only learn how to write web services from scratch, but also how to integrate existing services into your Java applications. All the source code for the examples is available from the book's companion website. With Java Web Services: Up and Running, you will: understand the distinction between SOAP-based and REST-style services; focus on the WSDL (Web Service Definition Language) service contract; understand the structure of a SOAP message and the distinction between SOAP versions 1.1 and 1.2; learn various approaches to delivering a Java-based RESTful web service, and for consuming commercial RESTful services; know the security requirements for web services, both SOAP-and REST-based; and learn how to implement JAX-WS in various application servers. Ideal for students and experienced programmers alike, Java Web Services: Up and Running is the concise guide you need to get going on this technology right away. :: 310 :: 	<BR/> :: 311 :: 	<STRONG> Ships from The Book Depository, CA, </STRONG> :: 312 :: 	USA :: 313 ::

And now, with the release of the 5.0 version of Java, O'Reilly has given the book that defined the in a Nutshell category another impressive tune-up. In this latest revision, readers will find Java in a Nutshell, 5th Edition does more than just cover the extensive changes implicit in 5.0, the newest version of Java. It's undergone a complete makeover-in scope, size, and type of coverage-in order to more closely meet the needs to the modern Java programmer. To wit, Java in a Nutshell, 5th Edition now places less emphasis on coming to Java from C and C++, and adds more discussion on tools and frameworks. It also offers new code examples to illustrate the working of APIs, and, of course, extensive coverage of Java 5.0. But faithful readers take comfort: it still hasn't lost any of its core elements that made it such a classic to begin with. This handy reference gets right to the heart of the program with an accelerated introduction to the Java programming language and its key APIs-ideal for developers wishing to start writing code right away. And, as was the case in previous editions, Java in a Nutshell, 5th Edition is once again chock-full of poignant tips, techniques, examples, and practical advice. For as long as Java has existed, Java in a Nutshell has helped developers maximize the capabilities of the program's newest versions. And this latest edition is no different. :: 347 :: 	<BR/> :: 348 :: 	<STRONG> Ships from The Book Depository, CA, </STRONG> :: 349 :: 	USA :: 350 ::

Like its predecessors, this fifth edition of Oracle PL/SQL Programming covers language fundamentals, advanced coding techniques, and best practices for using Oracle's powerful procedural language. Thoroughly updated for Oracle Database 11g Release 2, this edition reveals new PL/SQL features and provides extensive code samples, ranging from simple examples to complex and complete applications, in the book and on the companion website. This indispensable reference for both novices and experienced Oracle programmers will help you: get PL/SQL programs up and running quickly, with clear instructions for executing, tracing, testing, debugging, and managing PL/SQL code; optimize PL/SQL performance with the aid of a brand-new chapter in the fifth edition; and, explore datatypes, conditional and sequential control statements, loops, exception handling, security features, globalization and localization issues, and the PL/SQL architecture. This title also helps you: understand and use new Oracle Database 11g features, including the edition-based redefinition capability, the function result cache, the new continue statement, fine-grained dependency tracking, sequences in PL/SQL expressions, supertype invocation from subtypes, and enhancements to native compilation, triggers, and dynamic SQL; use new Oracle Database 11g tools and techniques such as PL/Scope, the PL/SQL hierarchical profiler, and the SecureFiles technology for large objects; and, build modular PL/SQL applications using procedures, functions, triggers, and packages. :: 384 :: 	<BR/> :: 385 :: 	<STRONG> Ships from The Book Depository, CA, </STRONG> :: 386 :: 	USA :: 387 ::

Now this same team provides the best explanation yet of these new features, and of concurrency in general. Concurrency is no longer a subject for advanced users only. Every Java developer should read this book. --Martin Buchholz JDK Concurrency Czar, Sun Microsystems For the past 30 years, computer performance has been driven by Moore's Law; from now on, it will be driven by Amdahl's Law. Writing code that effectively exploits multiple processors can be very challenging. Java Concurrency in Practice provides you with the concepts and techniques needed to write safe and scalable Java programs for today's--and tomorrow's--systems. --Doron Rajwan Research Scientist, Intel Corp This is the book you need if you're writing--or designing, or debugging, or maintaining, or contemplating--multithreaded Java programs. If you've ever had to synchronize a method and you weren't sure why, you owe it to yourself and your users to read this book, cover to cover. --Ted Neward Author of Effective Enterprise Java Brian addresses the fundamental issues and complexities of concurrency with uncommon clarity. This book is a must-read for anyone who uses threads and cares about performance. --Kirk Pepperdine CTO, JavaPerformanceTuning This book covers a very deep and subtle topic in a very clear and concise way, making it the perfect Java Concurrency reference manual. Each page is filled with the problems (and solutions! ) that programmers struggle with every day. Effectively exploiting concurrency is becoming more and more important now that Moore's Law is delivering more cores but not faster cores, and this book will show you how to do it. --Dr. Cliff Click Senior Software Engineer, Azul Systems I have a strong interest in concurrency, and have probably written more thread deadlocks and made more synchronization mistakes than most programmers. Brian's book is the most readable on the topic of threading and concurrency in Java, and deals with this difficult subject with a wonderful hands-on approach. This is a book I am recommending to all my readers of The Java Specialists' Newsletter, because it is interesting, useful, and relevant to the problems facing Java developers today. --Dr. Heinz Kabutz The Java Specialists' Newsletter I've focused a career on simplifying simple problems, but this book ambitiously and effectively works to simplify a complex but critical subject: concurrency. Java Concurrency in Practice is revolutionary in its approach, smooth and easy in style, and timely in its delivery--it's destined to be a very important book. --Bruce Tate Author of Beyond Java Java Concurrency in Practice is an invaluable compilation of threading know-how for Java developers. I found reading this book intellectually exciting, in part because it is an excellent introduction to Java's concurrency API, but mostly because it captures in a thorough and accessible way expert knowledge on threading not easily found elsewhere. --Bill Venners Author of Inside the Java Virtual Machine Threads are a fundamental part of the Java platform. As multicore processors become the norm, using concurrency effectively becomes essential for building high-performance applications. Java SE 5 and 6 are a huge step forward for the development of concurrent applications, with improvements to the Java Virtual Machine to support high-performance, highly scalable concurrent classes and a rich set of new concurrency building blocks. In Java Concurrency in Practice, the creators of these new facilities explain not only how they work and how to use them, but also the motivation and design patterns behind them. However, developing, testing, and debugging multithreaded programs can still be very difficult; it is all too easy to... :: 266 :: 	<BR/> :: 267 :: 	<STRONG> Ships from The Book Depository, CA, </STRONG> :: 268 :: 	USA :: 269 ::

To start, this book presents the essential SQL statements for retrieving and updating the data in a database, because that's what every application developer needs to know. Then, it shows you how to design and create a database, because application developers often end up in the role of database designer and DBA. Next, it shows how to work with views, scripts, stored procedures, functions, triggers, cursors, transactions, locking, security, XML data, and BLOB data with FILESTREAM storage. These features allow you to create database applications that are thoroughly professional. Finally, this book shows how to use the CLR integration feature, so you can use C# or Visual Basic to code stored procedures, functions, triggers, aggregate functions, and user-defined types. :: 358 :: 	<BR/> :: 359 :: 	<STRONG> Ships from The Book Depository, CA, </STRONG> :: 360 :: 	USA :: 361 ::

If you thought hacking was just about mischief-makers hunched over computers in the basement, think again. As seasoned author Wallace Wang explains, hacking can also mean questioning the status quo, looking for your own truths, and never accepting at face value anything authorities say or do. The completely revised fourth edition of this offbeat, non-technical book examines what hackers do, how they do it, and how you can protect yourself. Written in the same informative, irreverent, and entertaining style that made the first three editions hugely successful, Steal This Computer Book 4.0 will expand your mind and raise your eyebrows. New chapters discuss the hacker mentality, social engineering and lock picking, exploiting P2P file-sharing networks, and how people manipulate search engines and pop-up ads to obtain and use personal information. Wang also takes issue with the media for hacking the news and presenting the public with self-serving stories of questionable accuracy. Inside, you'll discover: How to manage and fight spam and spyware How Trojan horse programs and rootkits work, and how to defend against them How hackers steal software and defeat copy-protection mechanisms How to tell if your machine is being attacked and what you can do to protect it Where the hackers are, how they probe a target and sneak into a computer, and what they do once they get inside How corporations use hacker techniques to infect your computer and invade your privacy How you can lock down your computer to protect your data and your personal information using free programs included on the book's CD If you ve ever logged onto a website, conducted an online transaction, sent or received email, used a networked computer, or even watched the evening news, you may have already been tricked, tracked, hacked, and manipulated. As the saying goes, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you. And, as Wallace Wang reveals, they probably are. The companion CD contains hundreds of megabytes of 100% FREE hacking and security-related programs, like keyloggers, spyware stoppers, port blockers, IP scanners, Trojan horse detectors, and much, much more. CD compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. :: 286 :: 	<BR/> :: 287 :: 	<STRONG> Ships from The Book Depository, CA, </STRONG> :: 288 :: 	USA :: 289 ::

Indeed, that's what computers are for. You can enlist your own computer to automate all of your project's repetitive tasks, ranging from individual builds and running unit tests through to full product release, customer deployment, and monitoring the system. Many teams try to do these tasks by hand. That's usually a really bad idea: people just aren't as good at repetitive tasks as machines. You run the risk of doing it differently the one time it matters, on one machine but not another, or doing it just plain wrong. But the computer can do these tasks for you the same way, time after time, without bothering you. You can transform these labor-intensive, boring and potentially risky chores into automatic, background processes that just work. In this eagerly anticipated book, you'll find a variety of popular, open-source tools to help automate your project. With this book, you will learn: how to make your build processes accurate, reliable, fast, and easy; how to build complex systems at the touch of a button; how to build, test, and release software automatically, with no human intervention; technologies and tools available for automation: which to use and when; and tricks and tips from the masters (do you know how to have your cell phone tell you that your build just failed? )You'll find easy-to-implement recipes to automate your Java project, using the same popular style as the rest of our Jolt Productivity Award-winning Starter Kit books. Armed with plenty of examples and concrete, pragmatic advice, you'll find it's easy to get started and reap the benefits of modern software development. You can begin to enjoy pragmatic, automatic, unattended software production that's reliable and accurate every time. :: 311 :: 	<BR/> :: 312 :: 	<STRONG> Ships from The Book Depository, CA, </STRONG> :: 313 :: 	USA :: 314 ::

This new updated edition includes the same wisdom that made Allen one of the most influential financial advisors in the world, but also features updated information on everything readers need to know. The book features the original seven powerful methods that average people can use to make money on the Internet, and covers such topics as taking offline products online, niche marketing, successful Web-based business models, information marketing, affiliate programs, and more. There's plenty of new material in this Second Edition, including coverage of new federal and state laws covering spam and how to work around much of the new anti-spam technology active on the Internet. All the Web sites and online resources featured in the book have also been updated. Robert G. Allen (San Diego, CA) is the bestselling author of Multiple Streams of Income (0-471-38180-2), Nothing Down (0-671-50469-X), the largest selling real estate book in history, and the number 1 New York Times bestseller Creating Wealth (0-671-62100-9). He has taught wealth-building techniques to tens of thousands in seminars worldwide. A popular guest on radio and television shows, he has also been featured in the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, Parade, People, and Reader's Digest. :: 402 :: 	<BR/> :: 403 :: 	<STRONG> Ships from The Book Depository, CA, </STRONG> :: 404 :: 	USA :: 405 ::
