Everything is reversed over there. But if you accept the culture, and I accepted the culture, you can have a lot of fun. I'm glad I went. I've been eating a lot more sushi, especially since coming back. My favorites are shrimp, salmon, eel. :: 225 :: Pedro has been around for a long time. The secret to his longevity, Feliciano said, is his routine. Before every game, he soaks in a hot tub, plays catch, then runs a little to break a sweat. For innings one through five, he sits in the bullpen making fun of teammates and cracking jokes. Then he stretches, loosens his shoulder with a weighted ball and, when called, warms up. In the weight room afterward, he isolates his rotator cuff, his abdominal muscles, his lower back and his legs. :: 226 :: “I do the same thing because all I want is to be healthy,” Feliciano said. “Thank God I have.” (Ben Shpigel-NY Times-9/20/09) :: 227 :: <BR/> :: 228 :: On April 6, 2008, Feliciano took a couple of days off to be with his wife, Wanda, who was having surgery. :: 229 :: At the start of the 2011 season, Yankees G.M. Brian Cashman was forthright in his comments about how the Mets used Feliciano in 2010. :: 230 :: <BR/> :: 231 :: <BR/> :: 232 :: He was abused, Cashman said. It's a thin market when you're looking for lefties, and he's one of the better ones out there. But you don't typically go after a guy who's been used like that. The use pattern was abusive. :: 233 :: Mets pitching coach Dan Warthen says he is not an abuser, saying Feliciano's setting franchise records for appearances three straight years (86, 88 and 92 games) was done willingly by the southpaw. :: 234 :: Warthen said about the left-hander's heavy workload: [The Yankees] didn't know that when they signed him? ... He volunteered for the baseball every day. He was asked whether he was able to pitch. He said 'yes' every day -- every day -- and wanted to pitch more than we even pitched him. :: 235 :: I feel badly that [Cashman] feels that way, Warthen added. That was part of the reason we decided to not re-sign [Feliciano] -- because we knew we had used him 270-some times in the last three years. :: 236 :: Felciano didn't think the Mets' usage of him contributed to his injury. On April 2, 2011, he said his shoulder was getting stronger. But he doesn't like being on the DL at all. :: 237 :: Feliciano inked a two-year, $8 million contract in the offseason before 2011 spring training with a club option for 2013. :: 238 :: <BR/> :: 239 :: <BR/> :: 240 :: We do expect him to get back, Cashman said. It's not a major concern. If it becomes one, I'll let you know. :: 241 :: Asked if was an appropriate remark coming from the Yankees, an amused Warthen said: As you guys well know, this is the free world. You can say whatever you want.

In 2010, Feliciano worked hard at implementing a CUTTER to use vs. righthanded hitters. :: 266 :: Feliciano changed his delivery, now throwing from the side, at the urging of then-Mets Pitching Coach Rick Peterson early in the 2004 season. The sidearm slot makes him more effective against left-handed hitters. And he hides the ball better. :: 267 :: Peterson told Feliciano about his success of transforming former Oakland pitcher Buddy Groom into a sidearm pitcher. :: 268 :: At first it felt crazy, Feliciano said in September, 2004. But then I realized I could do it. :: 269 :: Peterson said the adjustment for Feliciano wasn't a dramatic shift, because, instead of having Feliciano change the angle in which his arm is releasing the ball, he's moving his torso down and to the side. When the ball releases, Feliciano's elbow is still in the same position as if he were throwing over the top. The key to throwing sidearm is to keep his head down and let the ball go. If he moves his head up, he loses velocity and control. :: 270 :: It is a way to help Pedro be more effective, Peterson said. Pedro has adapted very quickly. (help from: Amy K. Nelson-MLB.com-9/2/04) :: 271 :: Pedro is very effective against lefthanded batters, but righthanded hitters hit him. :: 272 :: During 2007 spring training, Mets pitching coach :: 273 :: <B> Rick Peterson </B> :: 274 :: said of Feliciano, His command is better, and his game awareness is better. He can read hitters' takes and swings and understand what they're trying to do, whereas before, you're almost so self-absorbed with what you're trying to do that you can't even see sometimes. :: 275 :: Peterson has stressed with Feliciano the importance of working ahead in the count, locating fastballs on both sides of the plate, delivering strikes when he is behind in the count and getting quality right-handed batters to hit the ball on the ground. :: 276 :: His process has been phenomenal, Peterson said, and it so happens that his outcome has followed right with it. (Bob Bellone-MLB.com-3/31/07) :: 277 :: In 2004, Feliciano's ERA against lefties was an impressive 0.75. But he also didn't pitch in many, if any, pressure situations. :: 278 :: <BR/> :: 279 :: In 2006, his 2.09 ERA ranked third among all National League relievers. :: 280 :: <BR/> :: 281 :: <BR/> :: 282 :: BREAKDOWN VS.

In high school, I don't think I even knew what a scout was, Chad said. :: 394 :: It was different in college. UMass-Amherst has a thriving baseball program. Players are accustomed to be watched by Major League organizations. But, at the time, Paronto was on track to beome a history teacher. To be totally honest, I never thought about getting drafted until my junior year,'' he said. That's when scouts started talking to me and sending me messages. Even then, I figured I'd get picked around the 30th round, not the eighth. :: 395 :: He is always willing to help instruct a fellow-pitcher with any adjustments to help their careers. He has fun going about his business, and he has a lot of energy. :: 396 :: Paronto's uncle, Dennis Paronto, never got to the Major Leagues, but he played in the Braves' farm system in the 1970s. I talk to him once a week,'' Paronto said. We have a very close family. They'll be in Cleveland on this homestand.'' :: 397 :: Chad likes to collect coins, go sailing or mess around on his computer in his spare time. :: 398 :: <BR/> :: 399 :: <BR/> :: 400 :: TRANSACTION REPORT :: 401 :: June 1996: Chad was drafted by the Orioles in the eighth round out of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. :: 402 :: November 2001: The Indians claimed Paronto off waivers from the Orioles. :: 403 :: February 2004: Paronto signed with the Cardinals organization. :: 404 :: February, 2005: Chad signed with the Brewers organization. :: 405 :: <BR/> :: 406 :: <BR/> :: 407 :: But on June 15, when the Brewers still had not called Paronto up to the majors, he took the out option in his contract and became a free agent. :: 408 :: <BR/> :: 409 :: <BR/> :: 410 :: May 9, 2006: Chad promoted to the Braves Major League roster. :: 411 :: December 18, 2007: Paronto signed a one-year, $500,000 contract with the Astros. :: 412 :: January 14, 2009: Chad signed with the Astros again. :: 413 :: January 17, 2010: Paronto signed with the Red Sox organization. :: 414 :: PITCHING: :: 415 :: Paronto's arsenal includes a quality 90-93 mph two-seam sinking FASTBALL, a 92-95 mph 4-seamer, a good SLIDER and a CHANGEUP. The sinker is his big pitch. :: 416 :: <BR/> :: 417 :: <BR/> :: 418 :: That's my priority pitch,'' Paronto said. ``It's not much of a secret when I come into a game. I'm going to throw the sinker. But the last couple of years, I've also developed a pretty good slider.'' Chad admits, though, When I throw the sinker well, I am successful. When I don't, I have problems. :: 419 :: After spending most of his first 5 years of pro ball as a starter, Chad found success coming out of the bullpen in 2000. He credits a lot of that success to meeting :: 420 :: <B> Moe Drabowsky </B> :: 421 :: while on a rehab assignment in 2000. :: 422 :: <BR/> :: 423 :: <BR/> :: 424 :: Moe completely turned my career around, Paronto said. Moe got me to be aggressive. That's been the key, not being afraid to throw a strike, going for the corner and keeping the ball low. It isn't anything I didn't really know, but Moe made a couple adjustments in my motion that really helped. I guess he just took a liking to me an dworked with me a lot. He told me over and over, 'Attack, attack.' He totally changed my approach. Now I try to come right at a guy and go for strike one. :: 425 :: He is a very dedicated and focused guy. He is coachable, wanting to improve. He can be self-critical. But he has no fear on the mound. :: 426 :: In May 2001, Paronto worked with Orioles pitching coach :: 427 :: <B> Mark Wiley </B> :: 428 :: on keeping his front side closed to the plate. By not flying open, it helped him keep the ball down in the more. :: 429 :: Paronto throws a heavy ball. It feels like a brick to the catcher. Hitters might make contact with hit, but they don't hit it well. :: 430 :: He is very competitive. And he is not afraid to come inside on a hitter. :: 431 :: During 2002 spring training, then-Indians Manager :: 432 :: <B> Charlie Manuel </B> :: 433 :: liked Chad's approach. I like the way Chad comes into a game. He wants the ball. Any manager wants to see that. :: 434 :: <BR/> :: 435 :: Chad enjoys coming into a ball game in difficult situations, men on base, opposing team threatening. And it's because he has thrived in these pressure packed situations that he's found a home in the Braves' 2006 bullpen. :: 436 :: <BR/> :: 437 :: <BR/> :: 438 :: Coming into those tough situations, it helps me focus, said Paronto. Believe it or not, I would rather come in tight spots with guys on base. :: 439 :: <BR/> :: 440 :: <BR/> :: 441 :: By adding a sinkerball to his arsenal and improving the movement on his ball he has increased his effectiveness, becoming one of the most reliable relievers out of the pen. :: 442 :: In 2006, Paronto allowed lefthanded hitters a .288 average with one home run in 73 at-bats; and held righthanded batters to a .234 average with 4 home runs in 137 at-bats. :: 443 :: <BR/> :: 444 :: <BR/> :: 445 :: In 2007, Paronto allowed a .33 average and his only home run allowed in 66 at-bats vs. leftanded batters, and a .287 average in 87 at-bats vs. righthanded hitters. :: 446 :: Chad entered the 2010 season with a career record of 6-12 and a 4.32 ERA. He had allowed 21 home runs and 200 hits in 183 innings. :: 447 :: CAREER INJURY REPORT: :: 448 :: CAREER INJURY REPORT :: 449 :: 2000 Season: A biceps injury cost Paronto the first two months of the season. :: 450 :: July 29, 2002: Chad went on the D.L. with tendinitis in his right elbow. :: 451 :: June 2, 2004: Paronto was on the D.L. with the Memphis RedBirds. :: 452 :: April 14-30, 2007: Paronto left the game against the Marlins with a strained right groin.

It has produced six major leaguers in the hockey-crazed state. :: 282 :: <BR/> :: 283 :: <BR/> :: 284 :: There is the Kraft Foods plant where cheese is processed, and the August Schell Brewing Company where beer is pumped out. Otherwise, they produce baseball players like catcher Terry Steinbach, who went to high school with Jamie's father, and now Hoffmann. (Two others, pitchers Doc Hamman and Fred Bruckbauer only lasted one game and did not retire a batter.) :: 285 :: Jamie was an eighth-round pick of the Carolina Hurricanes in the 2003 NHL draft and appeared destined for a career in hockey when he signed with the Dodgers, via scout Jeff Schugel, as a nondrafted free agent in August 2003. Like former all-star catcher Terry Steinbach, Hoffmann starred in both baseball and hockey at New Ulm (Minn.) High. :: 286 :: Hoffmann was the Minnesota 3-A baseball player of the year in 2002 but hadn't played much baseball when he reported to spring training in 2004. But his progress during the season was notable. Jamie ended up leading the Gulf Coast League in runs (40), hits (71), total bases (105), triples (seven) and RBIs (36), while finishing fourth in average (.310) and stolen bases (14). :: 287 :: <BR/> :: 288 :: <BR/> :: 289 :: You can tell he was a hockey player because he was always dirty, Rookie League Manager Brett Butler said. He's a very aggressive defender, a throwback player. (Baseball America-9/20/04) :: 290 :: It is rather interesting that Jamie chose baseball instead of hockey. Asked how he made the decision, Hoffmann said, I basically had one day to decide. Originally I decided to play college hockey and that was what I was going to do. I got drafted for hockey so that's what my plan was. I didn't get a whole lot of baseball attention but one day, right before the end of the summer before I was going to school, the Dodgers came in and watched an American Legion tournament. They gave me a day to decide and baseball was the way I decided to go. :: 291 :: Before 2006 spring training, :: 292 :: <I> Baseball America Prospect Handbook </I> :: 293 :: rated Hoffmann as 27th-best prospect in the Dodger organization. :: 294 :: <BR/> :: 295 :: <BR/> :: 296 :: After not being in the book for three years, Jamie was listed as the 30th-best prospect in the Yankees organization in the spring of 2010. :: 297 :: Hoffman's dad, Rich Hoffmann, is the sheriff of Brown County, Minn., and his departure for Los Angeles was national news. Rich Hoffman is presiding over the high-profile case involving a cancer-stricken teen, Daniel Hauser, who is refusing medical treatment. The teen and his mom have fled the state and defied a court order. :: 298 :: Jamie's hero as a youngster growing up in Minnesota, was Torii Hunter. Before that, his hero was Kirby Puckett. :: 299 :: <BR/> :: 300 :: <BR/> :: 301 :: How about his hockey hero: It was Mike Modano until the Northstars moved away and then probably Jeremy Roenick later on, Hoffmann said. :: 302 :: Hoffmann likes to go ice fishing during the winters in Minnesota. :: 303 :: Jamie has both great makeup and impressive ability. :: 304 :: <BR/> :: 305 :: <BR/> :: 306 :: TRANSACTIONS :: 307 :: December 10, 2009: The Nationals chose Hoffmann in the major league portion of the Winter Meetings' Rule 5 Draft, out of the Dodger organization. :: 308 :: <BR/> :: 309 :: <BR/> :: 310 :: But Washington immediately sent Jamie to the Yankees as the player to be named for acquiring P Brian Bruney from New York. :: 311 :: <BR/> :: 312 :: <BR/> :: 313 :: March 22, 2010: The Yankees returned Hoffmann to the Dodgers organization. :: 314 :: BATTING: :: 315 :: Hoffmann's swing is rather unorthodox and stiff. But he has excellent hand-eye coordination and keeps the bat in the hitting zone a long time. He uses the lower half of his body to drive the ball. He should hit 10-12 homers per season. :: 316 :: <BR/> :: 317 :: <BR/> :: 318 :: You look at him for the first time and (the swing) is ugly, Dodgers 3rd base coach Larry Bowa said late in the 2009 season. But he will figure it out. He is a tough guy. He reminds me of :: 319 :: Hunter Pence :: 320 :: . It looks ugly, but he gets it done. He is a big worker.'' :: 321 :: Jamie is a very good fastball hitter, but will have to learn to recognize breaking pitches in order to move to the top. Right now, he chases a lot of breaking balls. And fastballs on his hands give him trouble. :: 322 :: The Yankees picked Hoffmann in the Rule 5 Draft in December, 2009 after hitting coordinator Kevin Long watched a lot of film on Jamie. They believe he has a foundation for hitting that just needs to be tweaked. :: 323 :: FIELDING: :: 324 :: Hoffmann would knock the ball down with his chest and throw the runner out when he played third base in 2004, his first year as a pro. He is a good, nose-in-the-dirt 3rd baseman. He still needed to improve his footwork, but he is very coachable. :: 325 :: In 2005, the Dodgers moved Jamie to center field. His all-out approach makes him very playable there. He has the speed that gives him good range out there. And he has a good arm. :: 326 :: In 2008 and 2009, the Dodgers regarded Hoffmann as the best defensive outfielder in their minor league system. :: 327 :: <BR/> :: 328 :: <BR/> :: 329 :: He is a very good center fielder, but can play all three outfield spots. :: 330 :: RUNNING: :: 331 :: Jamie is an average runner, or a little better. He has 55 speed on the 20-80 scouting scale. :: 332 :: CAREER INJURY REPORT: :: 333 :: Mid-July, 2009: Hoffmann was on the D.L. for a couple of weeks. He had jammed his wrist sliding into 3rd base. It was sore, but an MRI was negative. :: 334 :: <I> Last Updated 4/15/2011 9:49:00 AM. All contents © 2000 by Player Profiles. All rights reserved. </I> :: 335 ::

I have to be a more mature hitter, get more strength and experience, Norris said during Arizona Fall League play in November, 2004. I just hope I continue to get better. :: 142 :: Norris has a knack for getting on base. :: 143 :: FIELDING: :: 144 :: Shawn plays 3rd base very well. He stands out at the hot corner because of excellent reflexes and fast, soft hands. He has the instincts and baseball-ability you like to see at the position.

He then spent two years at the team's Dominican academy (which the club no longer uses, instead bringing players to the U.S. once they sign). :: 228 :: In 2002, Iribarren hit .314 in the Dominican Summer League. In 2003, Hernan finished third in the Dominican Summer League batting race at .344. :: 229 :: In 2004, Iribarren's .439 batting average in the Arizona Rookie League was the second-highest in league history, topped only by the Padres' Tim McWilliam, who hit .451 in 1988, the league's inaugural season. Iribarren also led the league in hits (83), on-base percentage (.490) and slugging (.630) while earning MVP honors. :: 230 :: During the off-season before 2005 spring training, :: 231 :: <I> Baseball America </I> :: 232 :: rated Hernan as 9th-best prospect in the Brewers organization. And in the spring of 2006, the magazine had Iribarren as #15 in the Milwaukee farm system. :: 233 :: <BR/> :: 234 :: <BR/> :: 235 :: During the winter before 2007 spring camp opened, the :: 236 :: <I> Baseball America Prospect Handbook </I> :: 237 :: rated Hernan as 21st-best prospect in the Brewer farm system. And he was at #26 in the spring of 2008. :: 238 :: Hernan displays excellent knowledge of every facet of the game. :: 239 :: May 27, 2006: Iribarren was ejected from a game for using a corked bat and was immediately suspended for 3 games by the Florida State League, and another 3 games by the Brewers organization. Brewers farm director Reid Nichols was at the game, a 10-9, extra-inning win for the Brevard County Manatees, in which Iribarren was ejected in the sixth inning. Hernan's bat cracked and pieces of cork came flying out. :: 240 :: <BR/> :: 241 :: <BR/> :: 242 :: TRANSACTIONS :: 243 :: March 13, 2010: The Rangers claimed Iribarren off waivers from the Brewers. :: 244 :: January 5, 2010: Hernan signed with the Rockies organization. :: 245 :: BATTING: :: 246 :: Iribarren is a smart hitter, using the whole field, taking the ball the other way very well. A lot of his extra-base hits go to the opposite field. :: 247 :: <BR/> :: 248 :: <BR/> :: 249 :: He has a compact, line-drive swing. :: 250 :: Hernan consistently makes hard contact, despite being thing and wiry. His wrists are very strong. He is a slap-and-dash guy with the quick hands and flat swing plane the reminds you of Rod Carew or Luis Castillo. (John Manuel-Baseball America Prospect Handbook-January, 2006) :: 251 :: He can turn on a pitch on the inside corner of the plate or send a pitch on the outside part of the zone to the opposite field. He makes good contact and has good plate coverage for a free swinger. However, he has enough plate discipline, strike zone knowledge and patience to be a solid #2 hitter in the lineup. He lacks the discipline to be a leadoff hitter. :: 252 :: <BR/> :: 253 :: <BR/> :: 254 :: Iribarren lacks power, especially vs. lefthanded pitchers. He needs to focus on being a table-setter. :: 255 :: FIELDING: :: 256 :: Hernan is skillful on defense at 2nd base. He has quick hands and good range. His arm is strong. He provides excellent defense. :: 257 :: At times, Iribarren will take a bad trip to the plate back out to 2nd base with him. Maturity will enable him to overcome this flaw, however. :: 258 :: Hernan is not able to play anywhere other than 2nd base, so he lacks versatility. The Brewers did look at him in center field after the 2007 season in Instructional League. :: 259 :: RUNNING: :: 260 :: Hernan is an aggressive baserunner with excellent speed. But the problem is, his superb speed doesn't play very well. He lacks the instincts to steal bases very successfully. :: 261 :: CAREER INJURY REPORT: :: 262 :: March 24, 2006: Iribarren was standing just outside the batting cage when a teammate lost control of his bat, which hit Hernan in the mouth. The injury, which opened a cut requiring 20 stitches, did not cause dental damage. :: 263 :: <I> Last Updated 1/6/2011 10:43:00 AM. All contents © 2000 by Player Profiles.

Juan dropped out of a Massachusetts high school midway through his senior year, opting to showcase himself and play in a wood-bat league in Iowa. That move actually cost him in the draft, but it helped him make a smooth transition to pro ball. :: 177 :: <BR/> :: 178 :: <BR/> :: 179 :: Juan received a GED diploma and speaks fluent English. :: 180 :: Juan's father hails from the Dominican, and Portes still has family there. But his hopes of landing that pro contract were derailed by a technicality: He needed 365 days of residency in the Dominican by a certain date and had only attained 362. :: 181 :: Portes had to wait for the 2004 draft, and the Twins picked him in the 15th round. :: 182 :: The Twins signed Juan for a bonus of around $20,000. Jey Weitzel is the scout who signed him. :: 183 :: In 2004, Portes topped the GCL in slugging (.530), tied for the lead in homers (eight) and finished second in batting (.327), in 2004. (Baseball America-9/20/04) :: 184 :: Late in April, 2005, Juan left the organization for personal reasons. He has a child in the Boston area and wanted to be closer to his family. Even though Portes left without permission (he later called to explain his decision), the organization was not really upset with him. :: 185 :: He just took off, said Jim Rantz, the Twins director of minor leagues. We got hold of him by phone. He's got some things going on at home, some people who are putting pressure on him. He had a baby during instructional league [last fall]. We hope it works out. He's a young man with a lot of responsibility. He's going through some tough times. This kid is all right. I think he's got some things he has to address, then carry on. :: 186 :: Before 2005 spring training, the :: 187 :: <I> Baseball America Prospect Handbook </I> :: 188 :: had Portes as 28th-best prospect in the Twins organization. In the spring of 2006, the book had Juan moved up to #18. :: 189 :: BATTING: :: 190 :: Portes has very quick hands to get the ball to the ball in a hurry. He can turn a fastball around, pronto. His bat speed is very impressive, especially when considering his small build. :: 191 :: Juan can hit good pitching and really nail poor pitching. :: 192 :: FIELDING: :: 193 :: Juan has a very strong arm. But it is not all that accurate, so far. Most aspects of his defense need improvment. His hands are not all that soft. :: 194 :: Portes is becoming good at turning the double play at 2nd base. And in 2010, the Twins looked at him at 3rd base again. :: 195 :: <BR/> :: 196 :: <BR/> :: 197 :: Juan also is a good left fielder and can also play center. But his bat is ahead of his defensive ability at any position. :: 198 :: He is a team leader, taking charge on the infield, when he plays there. :: 199 :: CAREER INJURY REPORT: :: 200 :: Mid-August, 2009: Portes was on the D.L. for about a week. :: 201 :: <I> Last Updated 4/6/2011 3:41:00 PM.

It is effectively wild with excellent natural movement. :: 315 :: Hart has a good idea of what he is doing on the mound, pounding hitters with his fastball, cutter and breaking stuff. :: 316 :: Kevin repeats his delivery well and has a strong frame that allows him to pitch a lot of innings. In 2010, Hart had a better angle toward the plate, keeping his body from collapsing too far forward in his motion. :: 317 :: <BR/> :: 318 :: <BR/> :: 319 :: This sport is 100 percent muscle memory, so any time you get a chance to work on repeating something a thousand times in the offseason, it pays off, Hart said. I just need to get to a point where I'm going to be consistent with my delivery and repeat pitches. If I want to be able to throw a pitch low and away, I need to be able to throw it low and away. :: 320 :: Hart is versatile enough to project as a #4 or #5 starter, a middle reliever, or a setup man. He is best coming out of the bullpen. :: 321 :: Kevin cares a lot, probably too much. He puts a lot of pressure on himself to succeed. He needs to trust himself and let his natural ability play out. (Spring, 2010) :: 322 :: <BR/> :: 323 :: <BR/> :: 324 :: BREAKDOWN vs. LEFTIES and RIGHTIES :: 325 :: Hart allowed lefthanded hitters a .335 average with 4 home runs in 155 at-bats, while righthanded batters hit .278 with 7 home runs in 162 at-bats. :: 326 :: FIELDING: :: 327 :: Kevin pitched on Fridays and played first base the rest of the time for the University of Maryland. Playing first base helped him get used to fielding ground balls. He has very good instincts and reflexes on defense. :: 328 :: <BR/> :: 329 :: <BR/> :: 330 :: And, Hart is a good hitter for a pitcher. :: 331 :: CAREER INJURY REPORT: :: 332 :: June 2008: Hart was on the D.L. for about two weeks after suffering a concussion by a line drive to the head. :: 333 :: May 4, 2010: Hart had surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder. Dr. James Andrews performed the operation. The surgery put Hart out for the season but Andrews was optimistic that he would be totally recovered by the start of spring training in 2011. :: 334 :: <BR/> :: 335 :: <BR/> :: 336 :: Chris Carpenter had labrum surgery that cost him the 2003 season then bounced back to win the National League Cy Young Award in 2005 while pitching for St. Louis. Hart used Carpenter as inspiration during his rehabilitation work. :: 337 :: <BR/> :: 338 :: <BR/> :: 339 :: I'm extremely determined, Kevin said. This is one of those things where you try to find a positive. It give me the opportunity to get 100 percent healthy then focus on the pitching aspect, get back and really show everybody that you haven't heard the last of me. There are a lot of guys who have had surgery and done extremely good things. Chris Carpenter is a good example. :: 340 :: <BR/> :: 341 :: (Dejan Kovacevic, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette) :: 342 :: February, 2011: Hart was sidelined at the beginning of spring training with inflammation in his right shoulder. And he started the season on the D.L. :: 343 :: <I> Last Updated 3/18/2011 6:52:00 PM. All contents © 2000 by Player Profiles. All rights reserved. </I> :: 344 ::

(May 2009) :: 401 :: <BR/> :: 402 :: <BR/> :: 403 :: TRANSACTION REPORT :: 404 :: November 28, 2003: The Diamondbacks sent P Curt Schilling to the Red Sox, acquiring De la Rosa, P Casey Fossum, P Brandon Lyon, and OF Michael Goss. :: 405 :: <BR/> :: 406 :: <BR/> :: 407 :: But Jorge never played in the D'Backs organization, because three days later . . . :: 408 :: December 1, 2003: The Brewers sent slugger Richie Sexson, P Shane Nance and OF Noochie Varner to the Diamondbacks, acquiring De la Rosa, SS Craig Cousell, 2B Junior Spivey, 1B Lyle Overbay, C Chad Moeller, and P Chris Capuano. :: 409 :: July 25, 2006: The Royals sent INF Tony Graffanino to the Brewers, acquiring De La Rosa. :: 410 :: January 18, 2008: Jorge and the Royals avoided salary arbitration, agreeing to a $1.025 million contract plus performance bonuses. :: 411 :: May 1, 2008: De La Rosa was acquired by the Rockies as the player to be named that sent RHP Ramon Ramirez to the Royals at the end of March. The Royals are believed to have sent roughly $200,000 with De La Rosa to the Rockies, an amount that approximates the remaining difference in salaries between De La Rosa and Ramirez. :: 412 :: January 20, 2009: Jorge and the Rockies avoided salary arbitration, agreeing to a one-year, $2 million contract. :: 413 :: January 15, 2010: De La Rosa and the Rockies again avoided arbitration when he signed a one-year $5.6 million contract, with another $300,000 if he reaches 220 innings pitched in 2010. ( :: 414 :: <I> Editor's note </I> :: 415 :: : He pitched only 121 innings in 2010.) :: 416 :: December 3, 2010: Jorge signed with the Rockies, receiving a two-year, $21. :: 417 :: 5 million contract, which includes a player option for 2013 that could raise its value to $32 :: 418 :: .5 million. And the Rockies also gets a club option for the 2014 as part of the deal that could take it to $43 million. :: 419 :: PITCHING: :: 420 :: The lefthanded de la Rosa has been compared to the Braves' John Rocker, as far as stuff and body size. Jorge fires in the 90-97 mph range with his four-seam FASTBALL. He also has a hard wicked SLIDER, a plus sweeping CURVEBALL with some depth, an occasional CUTTER, and a nasty 75-77 mph CHANGEUP that moves in either direction, depending on his release point. :: 421 :: <BR/> :: 422 :: <BR/> :: 423 :: In 2004, De La Rosa added a two-seam fastball that has good sink. :: 424 :: Once a starter, Jorge is able to better exploit his ability out of the bullpen. He comes in and closes the door. :: 425 :: When he keeps his delivery together, he is a very good pitcher. He needs better command, though. And he needs to eliminate bad body language on the mound. De La Rosa will show his emotions out there at times. But Brewer pitching coach :: 426 :: <B> Mike Maddux </B> :: 427 :: straightened Jorge out in 2005, eliminating the sulky demeanor. :: 428 :: <BR/> :: 429 :: <BR/> :: 430 :: But in 2007, De La Rosa was overthrowing, a pitcher that Royals manager :: 431 :: <B> Buddy Bell </B> :: 432 :: called overcompetitive. When he starts overthrowing, he starts pitching away from contact and starts falling behind in the count. :: 433 :: <BR/> :: 434 :: <BR/> :: 435 :: It's not always stuff, Royals pitching coach Bob McClure said. It's competing and knowing yourself. It's knowing what you can and can't do. It's knowing your limitations and actually really believing that you are better than whoever is up there, no matter who it is. :: 436 :: What happens with Jorge is he needs to get practicing thinking one pitch at a time and not get too far ahead of himself so the game doesn't speed up for him. If you just go one pitch at a time, the game starts to slow down. :: 437 :: Jorge has a pretty good feel for the pitching craft. He and Dodgers legend :: 438 :: <B> Fernando Valenzuela </B> :: 439 :: were teammates with Hermosillo of the Mexican League in 2001 and 2002. And Jorge listened to Fernando intently. :: 440 :: <BR/> :: 441 :: <BR/> :: 442 :: I learned a lot from him, De La Rosa said. Every question I asked, he answered. He pitched for a long time and he knows a lot. :: 443 :: In 2009, De la Rosa had a remarkable turnaround. He was 0-6 in his first 10 starts, but after June 1 he went 16-3—the most wins in the Majors in that span. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, De La Rosa is only the third pitcher in Major League history, and the first since at least 1900, to win at least 16 games in a season in which he was 0-6 or worse through May 31. :: 444 :: <BR/> :: 445 :: In 2010, Jorge put up strong numbers in the second half of the year—opponents scored more than three earned runs off him only once in his final 14 starts. :: 446 :: <BR/> :: 447 :: <BR/> :: 448 :: BREAKDOWN VS. LEFTIES AND RIGHTIES :: 449 :: In 2005, this righty pitcher allowed a .321 average, but no home runs in 56 at-bats to lefthanded hitters. And a .273 average with one homer in 110 at-bats to righthanded batters. :: 450 :: <BR/> :: 451 :: <BR/> :: 452 :: In 2006, Jorge allowed a .250 average and 4 home runs in 60 at-bats vs. lefthanded batters. And a .269 mark with 10 home runs in 245 at-bats to righthanded hitters. :: 453 :: <BR/> :: 454 :: <BR/> :: 455 :: In 2007, De La Rosa held lefthanded batters to a .234 average with one home run in 107 at-bats. But righthanded hitters had a .321 average with 19 home runs in 420 at-bats. :: 456 :: <BR/> :: 457 :: <BR/> :: 458 :: In 2008, Jorge allowed a .289 average with 4 home runs in 121 at-bats. Righthanded batters had a .253 average with 9 home runs in 368 at-bats. :: 459 :: <BR/> :: 460 :: <BR/> :: 461 :: In 2009, De La Rosa held lefthanded batters to a .204 average with 2 home runs and 152 at-bats. Righthanded hitters had a .262 average with 18 home runs in 538 at-bats. :: 462 :: <BR/> :: 463 :: <BR/> :: 464 :: In 2010 Jorge held lefty hitters to a .206 average with 3 homers in 97 at-bats. Righthanded hitters had a .244 average with 12 home runs in 349 at-bats. :: 465 :: <BR/> :: 466 :: As of the start of the 2011 season, De La Rosa had a career record of 49-47 with a 5.02 ERA, having allowed 84 home runs and 723 hits in 711 innings. :: 467 :: CAREER INJURY REPORT: :: 468 :: March 13, 2004: De La Rosa injured his left groin during a spring training exhibition game and missed several days of action. :: 469 :: 2004 Season: Jorge had a sore elbow that caused him to lose command of his pitches. He was eventually shut down for a month. :: 470 :: June 10, 2006: De La Rosa was on the D.L with blisters on the middle finger of his left hand. :: 471 :: August 1–September 11, 2007: Jorge was on the D.L. with a strained left elbow. :: 472 :: October 2009: De La Rosa was left off the Rockies' post-season roster because of a strained left groin. :: 473 :: April 26-July 9, 2010: Jorge went on the D.L. with a torn tendon band in the middle finger of his throwing hand. He suffered it throwing a pitch early in a game he won vs. the Marlins, leaving after five innings because of numbness in the finger. :: 474 :: May 24, 2011: De La Rosa was on the D :: 475 :: .L. :: 476 :: and was lost for the season because of a complete tear of the unlar collateral ligament :: 477 :: . :: 478 :: Tommy John tendon replacement surgery was required :: 479 :: . :: 480 :: <BR/> :: 481 :: <BR/> :: 482 :: He began the 2012 season on the D :: 483 :: .L. :: 484 :: while still recovering from the Tommy John surgery :: 485 :: . :: 486 :: <I> Last Updated 5/26/2011 9:36:00 AM.

At first, I was pretty shocked, Eric said. You don't really see yourself in a trade. I had always been in the Cleveland organization.

I talked to him about trying to get my nerves under control. I've talked to him about hitting. He's been helpful. I've talked to him a lot about balance and pitch selection. He's not afraid to share information, but I'm pretty sure he hasn't shared all of his secrets. :: 269 :: Crozier worked on his batting stance and stroke before the 2005 season. He implemented some lessons taught by Toronto hitting coach Mike Barnett. :: 270 :: <BR/> :: 271 :: <BR/> :: 272 :: (In 2004) he was just still. It was tough to get anything going from a dead stand-still position, said Barnett. Now, he's down on his legs a little bit more, which allows him to drive with his legs. And he's got a little toe-tap, coming back, that allows him to get started and stay behind the ball. It just makes everything easier to follow through on the swing. :: 273 :: Eric's swing tends to get a little long.

He then transferred to North Carolina State. There, he was a decent college shortstop. He hit .320 with a little pop. He pitched some -- 13 innings over his 63-game senior season, going 2-3, 8.10 -- and had no complaints. :: 259 :: At the time, I was more valuable as a shortstop, Orvella said. I always figured I could fall back on pitching. I loved playing shortstop. I loved playing defense. :: 260 :: <BR/> :: 261 :: <BR/> :: 262 :: Chad moved to the mound after Devil Rays area scout Hank King (now a Padres scout) saw him pitch in a relief role at North Carolina State. :: 263 :: This kid had a special kind of mental makeup,'' King said. You look at him and you're like, are you sure? But don't let that look fool you. He's dead on. He looks like the batboy until he gets on the mound, and then he's a mountain.'' :: 264 :: College seniors don't have much negotiating leverage, and the Devil Rays signed Orvella for $2,500 -- up from the $1,000 they initially offered. Hank King was the Scout who signed Chad. (Help from Baseball America, July 2005) :: 265 :: At North Carolina State, Chad majored in communication. :: 266 :: During the off-season before 2005 spring training, :: 267 :: <I> Baseball America </I> :: 268 :: Magazine rated Orvella as 8th-best prospect in the Devil Rays organization. :: 269 :: <BR/> :: 270 :: <BR/> :: 271 :: And before 2006 spring camps opened, the magazine again ranked Chad as #8 in the Tampa Bay farm system. :: 272 :: He is mentally tough and has good makeup. :: 273 :: <B> In 2004, Orvella led all minor league relievers with 116 strikeouts in a combined 74 innings in 45 appearances. </B> :: 274 :: He had 12 saves in 13 opportunities and held opponents to a .159 average, walking just 10 batters all season. His 14.17 strikeouts/walks ratio was the sixth best in the minors. :: 275 :: In 2006, Chad didn't make the Rays' Opening Day roster, being the last cut. He had struggled during the spring. His ERA was 7.59. He allowed 12 hits and 10 runs -- nine earned -- in 11 innings. :: 276 :: However, the main reason manager :: 277 :: <B> Joe Maddon </B> :: 278 :: said Orvella was being sent down wasn't his stats, but because his delivery to the plate was too slow, meaning he wouldn't be able to control base runners. The optimum time to the plate is 1.3 to 1.35 seconds, Maddon said. Orvella's time was above 1.5 seconds. :: 279 :: <BR/> :: 280 :: <BR/> :: 281 :: Orvella is wonderful and we consider him a big part of our future and we felt it was better to tidy things up right now as opposed to later. It's better for him and it's better for us. We all love the guy and we think his stuff is wonderful. And he's going to pitch here, Maddon said. :: 282 :: <BR/> :: 283 :: <BR/> :: 284 :: TRANSACTIONS :: 285 :: June 9, 2009: The Rays released Orvella. :: 286 :: July 1, 2009: The Royals signed Chad. :: 287 :: March, 2010: Orvella signed with the Angels. :: 288 :: PITCHING: :: 289 :: The Devil Rays signed Orvella to pitch. And he has a 90-96 mph FASTBALL with late movement, a fairly good 81-82 mph SLIDER, a fine 12-to-6 CURVEBALL, and a straight CHANGE that is a good one because of the fade and depth it has. The changeup is his best pitch :: 290 :: <BR/> :: 291 :: <BR/> :: 292 :: My out pitch is my changeup, Orvella said of his weapon, which not only throws off hitters' timing but also moves down and away from right-handed batters. And lefthanded hitters have the most trouble hitting it. :: 293 :: Chad has pinpoint control. He really was a control artist who was not afraid to throw the ball over the plate. But in 2005, 2006 and 2007, he put himself in a hole with walks far too often. His command slipped. :: 294 :: He is aggressive and has a good feel for what he is able to do with his stuff. He has a compact delivery that he repeats very well. There is not a lot that goes wrong with his delivery. :: 295 :: In 2004, Orvella pitched in four different leagues and went a combined 1-1 with 12 saves and a 1.70 ERA. He walked just 10 batters and struck out 117 in 74 innings. :: 296 :: In 2005 with the Devil Rays, Orvella's best stretch of the season came from Aug. 13 to Sept. 8, when he had a string of nine scoreless outings in 13 innings pitched. Particularly impressive was his work against the Yankees and Red Sox. In 13 innings against the two powerhouse American League East clubs, Orvella allowed just four earned runs and held them to a collective .136 batting average. :: 297 :: <BR/> :: 298 :: August 15, 2006: Orvella recalled from AAA Durham. :: 299 :: FIELDING: :: 300 :: Because Chad is slow to the plate, runners steal a lot of bases on him. :: 301 :: <BR/> :: 302 :: <BR/> :: 303 :: He was sent back down to the Durham Bulls (IL-Rays) to start the 2006 season and work on quickening his move to the plate. He improved. Orvella's delivery to the plate is now in the 1.15 to 1.25 second range. :: 304 :: I mean, if he stays at a 1.25 to 1.35, I'll be happy, said Rays manager :: 305 :: <B> Joe Maddon </B> :: 306 :: , who noted Orvella had been on the upside of 1.5 with his delivery to the plate. That makes him a lot more functional against teams that like to run. I think it makes him more comfortable, in that he knows how to control those situations, too. :: 307 :: CAREER INJURY REPORT: :: 308 :: March 21, 2008: Orvella started the season on the D.L. with tendinitis in his right shoulder. :: 309 :: <BR/> :: 310 :: <BR/> :: 311 :: And on May 23, 2008, Chad had season-ending surgery to repair a slight tear of his labrum and rotator cuff. :: 312 :: Mid-July, 2009: Orvella was on the D.L. until near the end of August. :: 313 :: <I> Last Updated 4/7/2010 11:51:00 AM.

He absorbed the lessons of his father, Leo, a player of some local renown. Leo could have been a baseball player, and the Philadelphia Phillies wanted him to play Class D baseball, but he was already married and had started a family. Chris' dad went on to work for 35 years as a foreman in a food-processing plant. The family needed money so he had to give up baseball and go to work, Chirs says. But I hear stories about what a great athlete he was. :: 330 :: Chris was the youngest of 4 Michalak children, and the one with the most potential. :: 331 :: As a 14-year-old lefthander, he pitched 3 no-hitters during a single tournament, striking out 52 batters in 19 innings. :: 332 :: Growing up in Joliet, Illinois, Michalak was a fan of the Chicago Cubs. :: 333 :: Chris was quarterback for the Joliet (IL) Catholic High School football team that won the Illinois state title his junior year. Most interestingly, Michalak did it throwing the football RIGHT-handed. How's that for protecting the ol' pitching arm? His dad, Leo, told Chris he could play football only if he threw the ball righthanded. He told me that there were two different motions for baseball and football, Michalak said. I had a headstart playing baseball, and he didn't want me to screw up my left arm throwing a football. So I picked up the football with my right arm and started throwing it. :: 334 :: <BR/> :: 335 :: <BR/> :: 336 :: Also: There aren't too many left-handed quarterbacks in the NFL, says Leo. :: 337 :: He then went on to Notre Dame. :: 338 :: He has traveled all over the United States, Canada and the Dominican, in his quest for time in the Major Leagues. :: 339 :: Michalak turned pro when he graduated from Notre Dame in 1993. He then went through 6 organizations in 8 years in order to get to The Show. :: 340 :: In 1998, he made 5 relief appearances for the Diamondbacks, allowing 9 hits in 8 innings and posting an 11.81 ERA. Mark Connors was the Arizona pitching coach then. :: 341 :: <BR/> :: 342 :: In 2001, Michalak finally got another chance with the Blue Jays and Mark Connor, Toronto's new pitching coach. I hope it's alright to say this, his dad, Leo Michalak, a retired factory supervisor, said early in 2001. They've been living like gypsies. It's been hectic and trying, but he's stuck with it. He always had the confidence he could pitch in the Major Leagues, if someone would just give him a chance. :: 343 :: <BR/> :: 344 :: In 2001, Chris, his wife Shannon and two young children (Madison and Tyler) were rewarded when he made Toronto's Opening Day roster. Chris met Shannon in 1997. She was an elementary school teacher from North Dakota. When they got married, they left the church to the strains of Take Me Out to the Ball Game. :: 345 :: <BR/> :: 346 :: In August 2001, the Rangers claimed Michalak off waivers from the Blue Jays. :: 347 :: Chris is easy-going. He has dyed California bleach-blond hair that is thinning. :: 348 :: He was an extra in the big finale to the movie Rudy, in which Dan (Rudy) Ruettiger got to fulfill his lifelong dream of playing for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, if only for 27 seconds. Michalak was part of the crowd that cheered Rudy, Rudy, Rudy! Interestingly, Chris went to high school and later to Notre Dame with Ruettiger. I've seen that movie 20 times, but it still chokes me up, Chris says. :: 349 :: Besides Michalak, the Joliet, Illinois area has produced Major Leaguers Bill Gullickson, Jody Reed, Mark Grant, Sean Bergman, Mike Grace, Jesse Barfield, Kelly Dransfeldt and many other professional athletes. :: 350 :: July 29, 2003: The Reds sent a player to be named to the Rockies organization, acquiring Michalak. :: 351 :: February, 2004: Michalak signed with the Brewers organization. :: 352 :: Chris says he is an admitted baseball lifer. :: 353 :: <BR/> :: 354 :: <BR/> :: 355 :: Baseball is a big part of my life and pretty much my whole life, Michalak said yesterday. No matter what I end up doing even after I'm done playing, it will have something to do with baseball. :: 356 :: Don't misinterpret the left-hander's fixation on baseball with an inability to do anything else. :: 357 :: He has an undergraduate degree from Notre Dame but has pretty much determined he'll never put it to use in the job market. :: 358 :: Whether it's becoming a pitching coach or managing or even announcing -- I think I would have fun doing that -- but I'll be doing something where I'm around the game, he said. I don't think I'll ever be able to get away from it. :: 359 :: Chris and his wife, Shannon, have a daughter (born in 1997) and a son (born in December, 2004). :: 360 :: March, 2005: Michalak signed with the Blue Jays. :: 361 :: August 20, 2006: Chris' maternal grandmother, 102-year-old Rose Grant, died, so Michalak was given bereavement leave to attend the funeral in Joliet, Illinois. :: 362 :: January, 2008: Michalak signed with the Reds' organization. :: 363 :: April, 2008: Chris signed with the Rangers' farm system. :: 364 :: June, 2008: Michalak switched to the Marlins organization. :: 365 :: July, 2008: The Marlins released Chris. :: 366 :: Early in August, 2008, Michalak signed with the A's organization. :: 367 :: April, 2009: Michalak signed with the Blue Jays organization. :: 368 :: PITCHING: :: 369 :: Michalak (pronounced Ma-HALL-ak) has been able to stay around the game so long because he is lefthanded. But he can fool hitters with a dizzying array of CURVES, SLURVES, a CUTTER and a real-slow 83-85 mph sinking FASTBALL. He can throw strikes, change speeds and keep the game close when he is in there. :: 370 :: <BR/> :: 371 :: <BR/> :: 372 :: I'm not going to impress anybody with velocity, he said. So he must nibble with his change-up. And if that doesn't work, he must test his curveball. He'll throw in a sinker, occasionally offer a little cutter, he said. It's a mix-and-match mind-set he has developed over time. :: 373 :: After the first 2 months of the 2001 season, Major League hitters caught on to his changeup and umpires conspired against his pickoff move to first base, suddenly calling balks after deeming the move legal for over 2 months. :: 374 :: Michalak now comes from a submarine-style delivery. He went to Triple-A Indianapolis at the end of 2004 spring training to make sure he was consistent with the move. He had a super spring with the Brewers: 1.93 ERA in eight appearances. :: 375 :: When he was called up to the Reds in August, 2006, Cincinnati manager Jerry Narron used this brief description of Michalak: :: 376 :: Stuff-wise, he'd probably be considered a crafty left-hander, Narron said. :: 377 :: Michalak, who hadn't pitched in the Majors since 2002, was willing to translate. :: 378 :: I think what it means is that I don't throw very hard, Michalak said. That tag's followed me for a long time. :: 379 :: FIELDING: :: 380 :: Michalak's move to first base is a great one, allowing him to pick off a whole lot of runners. So good, in fact, that it borders on being a balk. But it has always passed the test -- at least until he got called for a balk in 3 straight games in June 2001. :: 381 :: <BR/> :: 382 :: <BR/> :: 383 :: In those 3 balk-marred games, Chris had an ERA of 9.22. In his 13 appearances before that, he had a 3.29 ERA. Blue Jays manager Buck Martinez said, Our concern is, one guy called it, now they are all going to call it. :: 384 :: He is a good defensive pitcher. :: 385 :: <BR/> :: 386 :: Chris notched a triple in his first official Major League at-bat, June 17, 2001. He had laid down sacrifice bunts in his first 2 plate appearances of the game. Then he came up in the 6th and lined a ball to center that got past a diving Milton Bradley (Expos) and rolled all the way to the wall. :: 387 :: RUNNING: :: 388 :: POST-PLAYING CAREER POSITIONS :: 389 :: 2011: Michalak was Pitching Coach for the Hagerstown Suns (SAL-Nationals). :: 390 :: CAREER INJURY REPORT: :: 391 :: April-May, 2007: Michalak went on the D.L. in mid-April, returning to action the 2nd week of May. :: 392 :: Early in July, 2008, Chris was on the D.L. for a couple of weeks. :: 393 :: Mid-June, 2009: Michalak was on the D.L. :: 394 :: <I> Last Updated 12/15/2010 4:38:00 AM.

He played his first three seasons in the Mets' organization under the name Roberto Solano. :: 206 :: He was originally signed by scout Eddy Toledo. A manager Concepcion played for in the Dominican had him change his name to Roberto Solano and decrease his age by one year, saying it would bring more money to his signing bonus. Concepcion was reluctant, to say the least. But being young and not knowledgable about the business end of baseball, he went along with it. :: 207 :: <BR/> :: 208 :: <BR/> :: 209 :: Ambiorix didn't know what to do if the truth came out. he believed his career as a pro ballplayer in the USA would end. With the weight of his dilemma on his shoulders, Solano struggled emotionally and mentally in 2003 and his play suffered, failing to hit a single home run at Kingsport. Listless in the field and lifeless in the batter's box, he decided to confess everything to John Fantuzzi of the Mets. Roberto Solano was gone and Ambiorix Concepcion was alive and real. :: 210 :: Concepcion works hard at this game he loves to play. :: 211 :: <BR/> :: 212 :: <BR/> :: 213 :: In the off-season, he works out five or six times a week in his native Santo Domingo, lifting weights, working on his swing and performing throwing drills from the outfield. :: 214 :: During the off-season before 2005 spring training, :: 215 :: <I> Baseball America </I> :: 216 :: rated Ambiorix the 5th-best prospect in the Mets organization. :: 217 :: <BR/> :: 218 :: <BR/> :: 219 :: But in the spring of 2006, he was dropped to #21 in the Mets' farm system. (His batting average dropped 54 points, and his age increased by 19 months over what he had said when he first signed). :: 220 :: Ambiorix and infielder Jose Reyes are good friends. :: 221 :: Concepcion has improved his English. :: 222 :: His teammates call him Amby or X. :: 223 :: Concepcion does not lack confidence. :: 224 :: November, 2008: Ambiorix signed with the Orioles organization. :: 225 :: BATTING: :: 226 :: Concepcion has, or is developing, five tools. As far as batting, he hits for both average and power. He can win a game with any one of his five tools on a given day. He is a run producer and a game changer. :: 227 :: Ambiorix will wait until the last minute for breaking pitches. He has good pitch recognition. But a long swing and a will to swing at about any pitch cause him to strike out a lot. However, he still manages to hit a ball he has no business hitting. :: 228 :: Overall, his hitting ability should allow Concepcion to hit .280-.290 with 10-12 home runs per season. But he knowsw home runs are not his game, So he has made himself a better contact hitter with power to the gaps. :: 229 :: <BR/> :: 230 :: <BR/> :: 231 :: That will come after he learns to work deeper into counts, not being so aggressive. His poor grasp of the strike zone foiled him. He has trouble with breaking pitches. He tends to be a free swinger. :: 232 :: Ambiorix has a swing that tends to get too long and keeping him from making contact. :: 233 :: <BR/> :: 234 :: <BR/> :: 235 :: But Concepcion has a knack for hitting some pitches he has no business making contact on. He is a good, bad-ball hitter. :: 236 :: FIELDING: :: 237 :: Ambiorix has plenty of arm for right field. And he has speed enough to cover lots of ground in center field. :: 238 :: Concepcion's arm is a real cannon. It is one of the best arms in all of the game. :: 239 :: He has good reactions to the ball and plays the game intelligently. He is a reliable defender. :: 240 :: RUNNING: :: 241 :: Concepcion is a rather speedy basestealer. That speed also enables him to take an extra base when most faster guys wouldn't even try. He is aggressive and applies his speed, though his running style can be described as reckless on occasion. :: 242 :: When stealing bases, Ambiorix gets thrown out more than you want to see. But he is good for about 25-35 stolen bases per year. :: 243 :: CAREER INJURY REPORT: :: 244 :: January, 2007: Concepcion fouled a ball off and broke his left foot in winter ball. Concepcion wore a boot and missed the beginning of the season. :: 245 :: <I> Last Updated 1/6/2011 2:43:00 PM. All contents © 2000 by Player Profiles. All rights reserved. </I> :: 246 ::

Abraham High School in Bristol, Vermont. But the Red Sox signed him for $240,000. Scout Ray Fagnant signed Pelland. :: 180 :: August 19, 2003: The Reds acquired Pelland from the Red Sox, along with P Phillip Dumatrait, sending P Scott Williamson to the Red Sox. :: 181 :: Before 2004 spring training, :: 182 :: <I> Baseball America </I> :: 183 :: rated Tyler as 8th-best prospect in the Reds' organization.

But they dropped him down to #17 in the Cincy organization during the winter before 2007 spring training. And he was down at #26 inthe spring of 2008. :: 189 :: PITCHING: :: 190 :: Pelland displays a 4-seam 88-95 mph FASTBALL that has pretty good late life. He also has a sinking 88-91 mph 2-seam fastball, has a tight SLIDER and a CIRCLE-CHANGEUP that is just below-average. :: 191 :: Tyler reminds you a bit of Mike Hampton with his delivery. He is a hard-throwing lefthander with good mechanics. :: 192 :: He works inside, showing no fear for knocking hitters off the plate. He also has a good feel for setting up hitters. But he has to eliminate throwing across his body and pitch more directly to the plate. And Reds minor league pitching coach, the late Vern Ruhle helped him do just that late in 2004. So he now has solid arm action and good mechanics. :: 193 :: Pelland is a durable lefthander. He retired lefthanded batters, but righthanded hitters do well against him. :: 194 :: All Tyler needs is improved command of his curve and changeup and he will rise to the top. Right now, :: 195 :: Pelland’s curve is inconsistent. When it’s not on, hitters can sit on his fastball because his circle changeup is below average and hasn’t developed as expected. (Baseball America-December, 2005) :: 196 :: Pelland should be OK as a lefthanded relief specialist. :: 197 :: FIELDING: :: 198 :: Pelland is a solid athlete, fielding his position well. :: 199 :: Tyler does a fine job of holding runners on base. :: 200 :: CAREER INJURY REPORT: :: 201 :: Early in August, 2008, Pelland was on the D.L. for the rest of the season. :: 202 :: <I> Last Updated 4/19/2010 4:46:00 AM.
