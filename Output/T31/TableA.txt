In short, what more could you ask of a rollicking good-time movie? Knight and Day, which also stars the irresistible Cameron Diaz as Cruises superspys ultimate foil, channels the best elements of earlier films like Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Mission Impossible, the Bourne films, and even a little of Duplicitys sophistication. Mostly, though, Knight and Day is about moving things along merrily, if not completely coherently, as the two stars tangle, and tussle with trust issues, in a completely believable, compulsively watchable way. Cruise plays Roy, an on-the-lam spy (who may have had some kind of psychotic break--or who may in fact be the only person telling the truth) he runs into the winsome June (Diaz), who gets caught up in Roys mad dash to escape the cabal of federal agents on his tail. No one follows us, Roy announces to a terrified diner crowd as he moves to make his escape with June, or I kill myself--and then her. While Knight and Day, directed by James Mangold, has more than its share of high-speed chases, hails of bullets, and explosions, it works far better as a romantic comedy--for the chemistry between Diaz and Cruise is delicious, palpable, and believable. So grab a date and an extra-large popcorn, and get ready for a sweet and fun Knight and Day. :: 214 :: 	Movie Photo :: 215 :: 	1-1	Thomas Winchester :: 254 :: 09 July 2010 :: 255 :: <STRONG> Funny but repetitive </STRONG> :: 256 :: Overall I have seen many other movies that were much worse. Cruise was funny and did an excellent job. Diaz just looks old and disgusting. It got a bit repetitive in some spots, the constant drugging, those who saw know what I mean.

And, I am so glad that I watched this one. Tom Cruise is the Mr. Original Cool and Cameron Diaz is the cute girl next door. The story is intriguing and doesnt loses its pace. It has enough suspense to keep you hooked to the end, enough action to keep you at the edge of your seat, and enough flirtish humor and romance to be fit as a romantic comedy. All in all, its a total package. The overall Yahoo User Reviews (B+..while writing this post n=568) as compared to the Critics ratings of C+, indicates that the Critics are doing something wrong and that they should be more realistic while writing a post. Credibility lies in honesty. :: 277 :: Martin Keith :: 278 :: 24 June 2010 :: 279 :: <STRONG> Great Movie </STRONG> :: 280 :: I went to this movie just to get out of the house at the last minute. I didnt expect anything. Instead I was very surprised. The audience was three quarters full and we all had a great time. Lots of good laughs and what was nice was that you didnt know what to expect or what was happening. You couldnt easily figure the movie out. It was far better than what the critics have said. I would say it has been one of the top 4 movies Ive seen this year so far. :: 281 :: Alma Reyes :: 282 :: 23 June 2010 :: 283 :: <STRONG> Knight and Day - Great! </STRONG> :: 284 :: ActionRomanceComedy - what more could you want?

Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller (Damon) travels across war-torn Iraq, pursuing the intelligence hes been given, but every site indicated comes up empty of WMDs. Investigating the source of the intelligence, he finds himself caught between CIA agent Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson, 28 Days Later) and politician Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear, Little Miss Sunshine) over the identity of Magellan, the supposed source. As Miller tracks down an Iraqi general, he ends up further and further afield, facing danger from all sides. Its hard to say which is the greater accomplishment--that Green Zone manages to turn a still-volatile political issue into a propulsive action movie, or that it manages to depict Iraqi people as individuals with a wide range of responses to whats happened to their country. Damons performance is low-key but effective as Miller tries to maintain some semblance of moral clarity in a circumstance that muddies everything. Also featuring Amy Ryan (Gone Baby Gone) as a compromised journalist and Khalid Abdalla (The Kite Runner) as an Iraqi civilian who gets dragged into far more than he expected. :: 224 :: 	Movie Photo :: 225 :: 	1-2	Melissa Cheatham :: 258 :: 17 September 2010 :: 259 :: <STRONG> Movie excellent, video quality poor </STRONG> :: 260 :: Like the title suggests I thought the movie (storylineactingetc.) was excellent. However the video quality in parts makes we want to complain to the people in charge of mastering the video. About half of the video looks good, as anyone would expect. While other parts and not necessarily the dark sport look just aweful. By that I mean very fuzzy. Its not the whole screen either. At times it seems to be centralized on an actors face. This movie does an excellent job in portraying what actually happened, when our troops entered Iraq in search of those elusive WMDs (that were never found!) Another point in this movie that is dead on, is how much different agencies in the U.S. do not cooperate with one another. There have been several interviews with people is these agencies that confirmed this claim. They still to this day argue about various intel. Overall this is a great movie that portrays truth in wartime scenarios. But dont waste your money on the Blu-ray version just yet. The video quality just isnt there to justify the extra expense. :: 261 :: David Meunier :: 262 :: 23 March 2010 :: 263 :: <STRONG> Movie an interesting take on Iraq war.... </STRONG> :: 264 :: It tries show that as good as a countries intentions are, there is always some way or some one to screw it up. BUT............... Music was too load and intense, distracted from the movie. Why is it that movie makers think they need loud background music all the time. The camera action made the movie intense and sometimes hard to follow because of the jerky movements and the music inter-feared with the ability to follow the camera movements. :: 265 :: William Burnside :: 266 :: 22 March 2010 :: 267 :: <STRONG> The Green Zone, the conspiracy theory </STRONG> :: 268 :: Its one of the conspiracy theories that most Americans didnt want to hear.

Cant handle the truth? The story of the movie is just great and gladly a Hollywood Big Name had the guts to play in it! An A for that Matt Damon! Most of the visuals are made like from a helmcam, but it suits the agenda. Overall its a way better movie than the Hurt Locker, but thats a different subject and angle anyway. Like I said, that somebody made this movie is the best part, that lots of people dont like to be reminded why the US is in Iraq is no surprise, just that they become insulting because somebody does not want to forget is very poor. On top of it, the story is a fiction, just that it is the same kind of fiction like the reason for this war were!! :: 273 :: Philomena Stephens :: 274 :: 20 March 2010 :: 275 :: <STRONG> The Progressive Extremists Crank Out Another </STRONG> :: 276 :: In the Old West, actors were considered one step above being a horse thief.

There its done...........now get on to some useful reviews :: 305 :: Bertha Solis :: 306 :: 03 February 2010 :: 307 :: <STRONG> Green Light For Green Zone </STRONG> :: 308 :: Green Zone is the latest Iraq War inspired motion picture. I wasntexpecting much and ended up being pleasantly surprised. Its a fastpaced and riveting ride from the get-go. The war being fought in thefilm is more between the Pentagon and the CIA than the US v Iraq whichmakes it all the more interesting and the film allows you to see thingsfrom Iraqs perspective for a change. The premise set up in the filmregarding the Intelligence regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction usedto justify the invasion is entirely believable. Matt Damon is wellsuited to his part as a unit leader Roy Miller, as is Brendan Gleesonas the CIA man and Greg Kinnear is refreshingly nasty as Poundstonefrom the Pentagon - all turn in good performances. Shot on location inMorocco, Spain and in England I could have sworn we were in Bagdad thewhole time - settings are very convincing. Yes, there is too much hand-held camera movement that quickly brought on discomfort followed by aheadache but that is my only negative and as the film doesnt outstayits welcome Im willing to concede the shakiness probably lends anembedded realism. Is any of the plot or characters based on realevents or people? I have no idea other than learning the film is basedon the 2006 non-fiction book Imperial Life in the Emerald City byRajiv Chandrasekaran, a journalist for The Washington Post. I haventread the book so I cant comment on how closely the film follows it. Ispent a few moments of the film wondering about the storysauthenticity but as a piece of cinema entertainment in its own rightGreen Zone gets the green light from me. :: 309 :: 	More Movies :: 310 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_373220.jpg :: 311 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 312 :: 	The Tourist (LQ) :: 313 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 314 :: 	Action, Thriller, Drama :: 315 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_372524.jpg :: 316 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 317 :: 	TRON: Legacy (LQ) :: 318 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 319 :: 	Action, Thriller, Adventure :: 320 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_367011.jpg :: 321 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 322 :: 	The Warrior's Way (LQ) :: 323 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 324 :: 	Action, Fantasy, Western :: 325 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_365406.jpg :: 326 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 327 :: 	Faster (LQ) :: 328 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 329 :: 	Action, Crime, Thriller :: 330 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_357188.jpg :: 331 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 332 :: 	Unstoppable :: 333 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 334 :: 	Action, Comedy, Drama :: 335 :: 	Copyright MoviesPlanet.com Â© 2002-2010 All Rights Reserved. :: 336 :: 	Support :: 337 :: 	/support.html :: 338 :: 	| :: 339 :: 	Privacy Policy :: 340 :: 	/privacy-policy.html :: 341 :: 	| :: 342 :: 	Terms of Use :: 343 :: 	/terms-of-use.html :: 344 :: 	| :: 345 :: 	FAQ :: 346 :: 	/faq.html :: 347 :: 	| :: 348 :: 	Help :: 349 :: 	/help.htm :: 350 :: 	Expand :: 351 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-green-zone-movie-7208.html# :: 352 :: 	next :: 353 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-green-zone-movie-7208.html# :: 354 :: 	previous :: 355 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-green-zone-movie-7208.html# :: 356 :: 	Close :: 357 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-green-zone-movie-7208.html# :: 358 :: 	Previous :: 359 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-green-zone-movie-7208.html# :: 360 :: 	0/0 :: 361 :: 	Next :: 362 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-green-zone-movie-7208.html# :: 363 ::

I actually liked grindhouse so when I saw the previews to this I was interested. I however did not expect the amount of racism and liberal B.S. This is a great example of how weve let this border debate go on too long. The vermon (Mexicans) actually think they deserve amnesty for just the hell of it. THANKS PROGRESSIVE GOVERNMENT SCUM (Obama). We preached human rights to the point of law doesnt matter to these people. This movie is kinda cool for a bit but other than the neat effects there is no point to it other than to entertain the Hippy pothead scum that support amnesty anyway. Avoid this film if you are a patriot or actually like good action films becasue this is not good. :: 257 :: Adam Walton :: 258 :: 06 September 2010 :: 259 :: <STRONG> Lots of Fun </STRONG> :: 260 :: Based on his fake trailer, writerdirector Robert Rodriguez crafts a film filled with mayhem, violence, girls with guns, nudity, explosions, lots of fake blood and Robert DeNiro. Sometimes a film like Machete is just what the doctor ordered. Designed like a 70s exploitation film, Machete is the type of film best enjoyed in a drive-in as a double feature with Piranha 3-D. This mindless popcorn movie is actually a lot of fun when you go in knowing what to expect and get exactly what you pay for. Its great to see character actor Danny Trejo finally get star billing and his hard, weather beaten look is just perfect for the title character. The supporting cast is really amazing. When will you ever see a film again with Robert DeNiro (as a sleazy, racist, senator), Steven Segal (as a Latin crime lord), Don Johnson (as a racist vigilante), and Lindsey Lohan (shooting up people dressed in a nuns habit)? This film is so over the top, its halfway down the other side. The movie also stars Jeff Fahey, Jessica Alba, Michele Rodriguez and Cheech Marin as one character more outrageous than the next. Lost in the mayhem is a point about immigration laws and illegal immigrants (mostly from Mexico) but Machete makes too much fun of itself to be taken seriously. :: 261 :: Matthew Valentine :: 262 :: 05 September 2010 :: 263 :: <STRONG> Machete- Comedy about the immigration issue... </STRONG> :: 264 :: Machete has a great plot- or should I say, it has many theories about what is going on behind the scenes of the immigration issue along Mexicos borders. All seem pausible. DeNiro, Cheech, Don Johnson are all great in it. Machete, the character himself, is not very charismatic- much like the character in Billy Jack films. That is probably the best way to describe this film Billy Jack goes to the Mexican border to fight the bad guys. Except Machete isnt very good looking but the women are gorgeous. The violence borders on ridiculous- intentionally unreal. Its a comedy- my favorite part? When the little ice cream cart, or the paleta cart, follows the cars and truck in for the raid. Dont blink, you might miss it. :: 265 :: Cornelius Katzman :: 266 :: 04 September 2010 :: 267 :: <STRONG> Viva La Raza Y Reconquista! </STRONG> :: 268 :: Never mind that our ancestor conquistadores stole the land in the first place -- but we never mention our treatment of those native Americans. Or that we cant get our own culture or country in order so well be a parasite on yours. And if you object we will play the race card and try to stifle debate or use it as blackmail against criticism. What a crock, making the lawbreakers look like the good guys, supposedly oppressed, whining victims, making a political movie thinly disguising a very bad movie. Save your money. :: 269 :: Becky Kelley :: 270 :: 03 September 2010 :: 271 :: <STRONG> They just effed with the wrong Mexican. </STRONG> :: 272 :: Do me a favor and look outside your window right now. See all of those brown people slaughtering your white neighbors? That can only mean that Machete is now in theaters and Alex Jones Helter Skelter prediction has come true. Thats right this film is so damn cool that the trailer alone convinced a right-wing media maniac cursed with the power to constantly (and hysterically) predict things that never ever actually come to pass that racial Armageddon was upon us and that our gardeners and housekeepers were plotting against us all along. This movie was to be the signal. Be afraid, my Caucasian friends. Be very afraid. Oh, wait. Sorry. Turns out its just a cheesy summer action film and everybody who saw it had a great time. My bad. Machete began its life as a spoof trailer presented in between films during the massive box office failure that was Robert RodriguezQuentin Tarantinos Grindhouse double-feature. If youd told me that the 70s exploitation homage starring Danny Trejo would spawn its own feature film, Id have said I wish. Wish granted. And then some. While the finished product is probably too slick to be properly considered grindhouse material, it is almost certainly the baddest, bloodiest, sexiest, most hardcore, and most controversial film of the summer. I hear this this other little star-studded action film homage thing out this summer. Well, said film is likely to have expended its popularity a matter of months from now, while Machete looks to be a cult classic shoe-in that will be enjoyed for years to come. This movie is phenomenally entertaining at every level. Lets start with the cast. Imagine an action film with Robert DeNiro, Steven Seagal, and Tom Savini. That is three very different shades of awesome right off the bat. And those are just the villains. Topping the incredible cast is man-god Danny Trejo (FINALLY headlining) with Cheech Marin playing his brother, but that is still not all. Man cannot live on sausage alone so we get Michelle Rodriguez in her hottest role to date and the unconscionably sexy Jessica Alba to boot. Also Lindsay Lohan, looking much less gaunt and strung out than in recent years and much more like the sweet thing she used to be. In fact, this is probably the sexiest female cast ever assembled on top of the killer selection of leading men and they are taking full advantage. Yeah, Im going to rain on some parades and call this the best cast in an action film yet. Deal. Also in the win column (which is a loooong column) is the tone of the film itself. Rodriguez is simply the best action director in the business, but he also has one of the best sense of humors out there. Machete comes off not only as a modern 70s exploitation homage and a BOLD statement against the media-fueled hatred and bigotry that persistently plagues non-white immigrants its also very funny. Whenever the hero is about to get his groove on, the audience is treated a porntastic funk flourish while the rest of the film is peppered with an agreeably seamless combination of hard rock and traditional Mexican music. Rodriguez scores are always fabulous. And while the immigration issue is handled with all of the subtlety and nuance of a weedwhacker, the satire and celebration of Mexican culture is sure to raise a lot of smiles in certain communities. Trejo leading a brigade of gaudy lowriders bumping hydraulics or taking on armed guards with an assortment of gardening tools is just too funny any way you look at it. Lets not forget that this movie is not aiming to be an intellectual assessment of the current political climate in America (although it does a surprising job of summing it up and some of this stuff is not entirely fiction) its just a rollicking good action flick deliberately extending its middle finger to people who are frankly too stupid to even deserve to see a film this fun. Theres always that other movie for those people. Machete is a character that combines everything you love about heroes like Shaft, El Mariachi, Rambo, and Dirty Harry and cranks it up to levels previously unheard of. He gets the girl. He gets all the girls. He kills the bad guys. All of them too. And most of all, Machete dont text. Because texting is for losers. Want more onscreen sex and violence than the other flicks will give you? Bam! It gives you every ridiculous thing you saw in the Grindhouse trailer and much, much more. Im talking about intestine-swinging, decapitating, seppuku-tastic, eye-shooting, machine-gun motorcycling, pure goddamn cinematic badness through and through. All that and harsh political commentary from a director who is not afraid to stick up for the little guy in the biggest possible way. This is likely the best thing Ill see on the big screen all year. And it didnt even start a race war. Thats what I call a win-win, baby. :: 273 :: Angela Solomon :: 274 :: 02 September 2010 :: 275 :: <STRONG> Another fun ride from Director Rodriguez </STRONG> :: 276 :: I am not quite sure, if a full length feature could live up to the mega cool fake trailer that played before Grindhouse 2 years ago, but I am a fan of director Robert Rodriguez, so the promise is there. This film is the perfect midnight movie, and I was so glad I made a last minute decision to see the 1201 showing here in LA. The film delivered as promised, the movie retains the grindhouse feel, leftover from Planet Terror, its bloody, some nice nudity and a cast that all seem like they are enjoying the hell out of the material. Its great seeing usual supporting player Danny Trejo in the starring role. Michelle Rodriguez looks great in this, and say what you will about Lindsay Lohan, but she looks stunning running around much of the movie with her long hair barely covering her boobies. It was NICE! The plot is straight Mex-ploitation, and with the current political climate, I am not sure the timing of the release could have been planned any better. The best promotion for the film is going to be the 6 oclock news in most major cities. If I have one complaint, I felt the running time was a little long by about 20 minutes. It should have been shorter and sweeter leaving the viewer clamoring for more. The end promises 2 more sequels, which will be perfect for the straight to DVD market after gaining a cult audience with this theatrical release. This is not the kind of film that is going to play to the mainstream, but fans of Robert Rodriguezs work will not be disappointed grab a couple of buddies kick back and enjoy the bloody over-the-top mayhem. :: 277 :: 	More Movies :: 278 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_373220.jpg :: 279 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 280 :: 	The Tourist (LQ) :: 281 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 282 :: 	Action, Thriller, Drama :: 283 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_372524.jpg :: 284 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 285 :: 	TRON: Legacy (LQ) :: 286 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 287 :: 	Action, Thriller, Adventure :: 288 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_367011.jpg :: 289 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 290 :: 	The Warrior's Way (LQ) :: 291 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 292 :: 	Action, Fantasy, Western :: 293 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_365406.jpg :: 294 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 295 :: 	Faster (LQ) :: 296 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 297 :: 	Action, Crime, Thriller :: 298 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_357188.jpg :: 299 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 300 :: 	Unstoppable :: 301 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 302 :: 	Action, Comedy, Drama :: 303 :: 	Copyright MoviesPlanet.com Â© 2002-2010 All Rights Reserved. :: 304 :: 	Support :: 305 :: 	/support.html :: 306 :: 	| :: 307 :: 	Privacy Policy :: 308 :: 	/privacy-policy.html :: 309 :: 	| :: 310 :: 	Terms of Use :: 311 :: 	/terms-of-use.html :: 312 :: 	| :: 313 :: 	FAQ :: 314 :: 	/faq.html :: 315 :: 	| :: 316 :: 	Help :: 317 :: 	/help.htm :: 318 :: 	Expand :: 319 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-machete-movie-10049.html# :: 320 :: 	next :: 321 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-machete-movie-10049.html# :: 322 :: 	previous :: 323 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-machete-movie-10049.html# :: 324 :: 	Close :: 325 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-machete-movie-10049.html# :: 326 :: 	Previous :: 327 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-machete-movie-10049.html# :: 328 :: 	0/0 :: 329 :: 	Next :: 330 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-machete-movie-10049.html# :: 331 ::

Out to exact revenge on the varmint who wrecked his face and killed his family, Jonah also gets yanked back into the service of his country--against his will, of course. Said varmint, Quentin Turnbull, is played by John Malkovich, although the more spirited villainy is provided by Turnbulls tattooed Irish assistant (Inglourious Basterdss Michael Fassbender plays the part with the kind of energy noticeably absent from the other cast members). In this 80-minute hodgepodge of a movie, Jonah regularly checks in with his lady friend, a prostitute (Megan Fox) whose bordello room has a remarkable amount of glamour lighting, and in his spare time investigates Turnbulls plot to use a super weapon against Washington, D.C. By giving Jonah a halfway-interesting supernatural talent--he can talk with the dead, by placing his hands on them--the film adds a kicky new wrinkle, but its not enough to improve the mangled storytelling or the sleepwalking pace. Brolins makeup is impressive, but in scarring his cheek and pulling his mouth back in a grotesque grimace, the prosthetics designers have robbed the actor of any ability to express himself through speech. Kind of a miscalculation there, and typical of this movies tendency to shoot itself in the face. DVD and First HD 720p PC, Mac, PS3 and XBOX 360 COMPATIBLE :: 223 :: 	Movie Photo :: 224 :: 	1-4	Arnold Hall :: 255 :: 07 October 2010 :: 256 :: <STRONG> An incoherent mess </STRONG> :: 257 :: This film is about a man who saw his family got murdered, and his facegot burnt. He sets out to hunt for this bad guy on the request of thegovernment. Jonah Hex is terrible. I watched over half of the movie and I barelyunderstood the plot, if there was one. The story seems to jump aroundquickly. The unattractive lead character prevented me from liking thefilm. Megan Foxs role seems to be there to show skin only. The colourscheme of orange and brown (to make it look Western) bothers me too, asthe filmmakers really overdo the colours. They could have at leastadded more colours to make Jonah Hex look visually attractive. Ithink the filmmakers are too preoccupied with the idea of making a coolWestern movie like a comic book movie, but they fail so miserably. :: 258 :: Marilyn Yost :: 259 :: 02 October 2010 :: 260 :: <STRONG> waste of a potential good story </STRONG> :: 261 :: Just watched this film and wish i hadnt.... when a writer creates anew story or screenplay they often write a start, they then write keystages throughout the story followed by an ending. When all this is inplace they complete all the details in between. It seems with this filmsomeone forgot to write all the details in between!! The film seemed to be one action sequence followed by another with somechildish directing editing in between just to split up the actionscenes..... I hear action fans say oh well at least it will be entertaining withall the action.... sorry the actions pretty poor as well. Its always good to see Megan fox in skimpy clothing but her role waskind of like parsley on a steak - just for garnish. So much more couldhave been made of her character. Josh brolin must be annoyed with himself for allowing the film company director to make such a lemon of a film with him in it! Indeed therewere several good quality actors in this production but no one wasallowed to shine or develop any characters at all.... Such a shame this could have been a quirky, interesting, fun film butHollywood decided to make utter rubbish instead. I wonder why theyallow themselves to make mistakes like this so often. Is there truly noimagination left in Hollywood? PS nice corset Megan. You look great even in a waste of a movie likethis!! :: 262 :: David Cortez :: 263 :: 19 July 2010 :: 264 :: <STRONG> Wait a minute people.... </STRONG> :: 265 :: First off, this movie was filmed twice. The original director turned his cut in and then the studio hired another guy (uncredited) to reshoot almost the entire movie. He added the stupid talk to the dead stuff and the super weapon garbage. If you read the original script, the one where Thomas Jane all but begged to star in, it is a hard R violent, vengeance driven western. I have long been a Jonah Hex fan and when I heard about them making this movie, I put in my JOSEY WALES dvd and got out my 1970-1972 comic books and hoped for the best. Although I was disappointed, it was still fun to watch. :: 266 :: Shannon Rogers :: 267 :: 27 June 2010 :: 268 :: <STRONG> Not worth seeing </STRONG> :: 269 :: The movie was not worth seeing. I should have stayed home and sat in the dark. It was so far from the comic book that you could have called it The Movie of ....Nothing It was just a bad film. Save your money and buy beer. :: 270 :: Margaret Ryan :: 271 :: 19 June 2010 :: 272 :: <STRONG> This summer Get Hexed! </STRONG> :: 273 :: In the summer of nepotism, reboots and sequels Jonah Hex rules. Finally a fresh, new, well done action movie. Top notch acting, screenwriting, cinematography. Im no fanboy and never read comic books.

Ah, it could only be Clash of the Titans, the 2010 remake that retains the instruction to unleash the great beastie from the sea. The 1981 original boasted Ray Harryhausens legendary stop-motion technique of animating various mythological creatures--it was his final feature project--and given the cornball approach of the movie in general, that was the main draw. The remake supplies new state-of-the-art special effects (released in 3-D) and a nicely muscular sense of momentum. Sam Worthington (the Avatar guy) plays Perseus, a demigod who doesnt know that Zeus (Liam Neeson) is his father. Perseus is selected to lead an expedition to find and slay the Medusa, lest Zeuss evil brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes, in fine slinking mode) rain down misery upon a seaport--and you just know that means the Kraken is coming. Ye gods, its a mess, and we havent even mentioned the witches and the harpies and the giant scorpions. But if we did, it would be clear that Clash of the Titans is a perfectly dandy popcorn epic, unpretentious and punchy. Director Louis Leterrier (Transporter 2) gets a fine rhythm going during Perseuss trek, and you can even forgive the hokey shafts-of-light-through-clouds look of Olympus. Leterrier also had the good sense to import the marvelous Danish star Mads Mikkelsen to provide mentoring duties to Perseus Gemma Arterton and Alexa Davalos fulfill the eye-candy roles. Its up to individual viewers to choose which they prefer--Harryhausens magically hand-wrought creations (his Medusa sequence is an absolute killer) or the 21st centurys slick computer-generated variations. But nostalgia aside, it would be hard to deny that this is one case where the remake tops the original. :: 218 :: 	Movie Photo :: 219 :: 	1-8	Sylvia Snow :: 254 :: 24 April 2010 :: 255 :: <STRONG> Fun adventure movie </STRONG> :: 256 :: Demi-god Perseus (Sam Worthington), the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson) and a human mother, undertakes a quest to save the city of Argos from the wrath of the Kraken, an enormous sea monster that the gods plan to release as punishment for defiance. Director Louis Leterrier keeps the pace snappy and handles CGI creatures well, as he demonstrated with The Incredible Hulk. Some reviewers want more story, but it seems to me that the figures of Greek myth are generally at the mercy of fate and destiny, so I didnt miss the lack of motivations rooted deeply in character. I also didnt mind the scrambling of mythology, although I wouldnt recommend this movie as a source for college students trying to crank out a term paper on Greek myths at the last minute. I didnt even mind Perseuss buzzcut in a world where everyone else (even some of the women) have beards and long hair. At least its easy to pick him out of a crowd. The giant scorpions, the Medusa, the harpies, and the Kraken all looked great and the action was exciting enough to keep me happily shoveling popcorn into my mouth. BTW, I elected to see the film in 2D since I had read some bad reviews of the murky look of the film after the last minute decision to switch it to 3D. Avatar demonstrated that 3D technology has finally arrived and is worth the extra bucks when done right. However, too many Hollywood productions trying to jump onto the bandwagon with substandard product may make moviegoers think twice about paying higher ticket prices. :: 257 :: Loretta Lawrence :: 258 :: 19 April 2010 :: 259 :: <STRONG> awesome remake </STRONG> :: 260 :: Two things of why I think this movie is cool. great CGI and greataction scenes even though it was quick. Heres the plot from Wikipedia.The film begins with a narration by Io, explaining that there wereoriginally three Gods Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. The Gods defeatedtheir greatest enemies, the Titans, with the help of Hadess creation,the Kraken. After the Titans defeat, Zeus created humans and ruledthem while Poseidon ruled the sea, but Hades, having been deceived byhis brother Zeus was forced to rule the Underworld, constantly plottingto take Zeuss throne for himself.A fisherman, Spyros, finds a coffin adrift in the sea, discovering ababy, Perseus, and his dead mother, Dana, inside. Spyros decides toraise Perseus as his own. Years later, Perseus and his family arefishing when they witness a group of soldiers from Argos destroying astatue of Zeus and declaring war against the Gods. Hades appears andcommands harpies to massacre the soldiers. The harpies then destroyPerseuss familys fishing boat. Perseus tries to save his family butto no avail, the surviving soldiers take Perseus back to Argos.During a feast for the returning soldiers King Cepheus and QueenCassiopeia of Argos compare themselves and their daughter, Andromeda,to the Gods. Andromeda is against fighting the Gods, and is protestingwhen Hades appears and kills the remaining soldiers. Perseus isunaffected however, and Hades realizes Perseus is a demigod and revealsZeus is Perseuss father. Hades kills the queen, and threatens that ifPrincess Andromeda is not sacrificed to the Kraken, Argos will bedestroyed in 10 days.The king seeks the help of Perseus. Perseus initially refuses, butdecides to help when he meets Io, a woman who does not age aspunishment for refusing to be seduced by a God. Io has watched overPerseus from the time he was born, and assures him he can have hisrevenge against Hades if he helps Argos in its time of need. Perseusand Io embark on a quest to find the Stygian Witches. Hades enlistsAcrisius, the former king of Argos who was married to Dana when Zeusimpregnated her with Perseus. Acrisius was leading men to attackOlympus, and while other gods wanted to annihilate Acrisius, Zeuswanted to make an example of him. He Snuck into Danas bed in the formof Acrisius and impregnated her. Acrisius declared that the baby couldnot be born, and set Dana and the baby Perseus adrift in their coffinfor this act, Zeus struck Acrisius with lightning, leaving himhideously disfigured. Hades imbues him with powers to aid him inkilling Perseus, and Acrisius takes the name of Calibos. While in thewoods, Perseus and his men discover a sword forged in Olympus that willonly display power if it is wielded by Perseus. Perseus also discoversa winged horse called Pegasus. Perseus refuses to use either of thesegifts, as he does not wish to be a God. Calibos attacks the group ledby Perseus. They severe the hand of Calibos, but Calibos blood formsgiant scorpions from the sand, and Perseus and his group are attacked.Though they slay several scorpions, most of the group are slain, andthe survivors surrounded by more of the monsters. They are saved by theDjinn, sand-demons with magical powers who tame the scorpions. Perseusand the Djinn agree to cooperate, since the Djinn wish to see the Godsdefeated.At the Garden of Stygia, the Stygian Witches tell Perseus that the headof Medusa could kill the Kraken, but that Perseus will die in theprocess. After leaving the witches, Perseus is visited by Zeus whooffers him asylum on Mount Olympus. He refuses. Zeus gives him insteada golden drachma. Perseus uses the coin to bribe Charon for passageinto the Underworld and enters Medusas lair. Although four of Perseusremaining soldiers fight hard to stay alive, one by one they are turnedto stone by her gaze. Draco, one of the soldiers with Perseus, allowshimself to be turned to stone to give Perseus a clear shot at Medusashead. Perseus kills Medusa, but Calibos returns and kills Io. Perseusengages Calibos in combat and kills him, using the sword from Olympusto stab him in the heart and turn him back into Acrisius in human form.With his final breaths, Acrisius tells Perseus to never become a God.Perseus rides Pegasus back to Argos with Medusas head to find thecitizens of Argos planning to sacrifice Andromeda to the Kraken, whohas been summoned by Hades. Hades reveals to Zeus the destruction ofArgos will give him enough power to overthrow the other Olympians. Zeusattempts to banish Hades back to the Underworld, but Hades overpowershim. Zeus then reveals to Hades that Perseus is still alive and is inArgos. Hades leaves to oversee the Krakens attack and ensure hisvictory.Perseus returns to Argos, but Hades sends harpies to kill him. Perseusdefeats the creatures sent by Hades and uses the head of Medusa to turnthe Kraken into stone. Hades arrives just in time to see his creationdie. Perseus draws his sword, but Hades reminds him that he is a God,and therefore cannot be killed. Perseus replies that though Hades canlive forever, it will not be in the world of men and throws his swordat Hades, charged with a bolt of lightning from Zeus that banishesHades to the Underworld. After saving Argos from destruction, Andromedasuggests that Perseus become king and rule Argos at her side, but hedeclines.Zeus appears before Perseus again and offers to make him a God, but herefuses. Zeus warns Perseus that Hades will return to rule the world indarkness when mankind is fearful. Since Perseus is intent to stay onEarth, Zeus resurrects Io, and the two embrace while Pegasus fliesabove them. :: 261 :: Ramon Adelman :: 262 :: 18 April 2010 :: 263 :: <STRONG> It Was Entertaining </STRONG> :: 264 :: I saw the Clash of the Titans remake over the weekend, and it was entertaining. It wasnt great, bit it wasnt bad either. Its sorta in the middle. The special effects is definitely better than the original. I also liked the cinematography as well as the fight scenes. I also liked the character of Perseus had been broaden about his feelings about not wanting to be a god.I dont see any use of the 3D glasses with the exception with the battle against the Kraken at the end.It was a fun film to watch and worthy of a matinee price.I give it 3 stars out of five. :: 265 :: Sheldon Risner :: 266 :: 15 April 2010 :: 267 :: <STRONG> Such a dissapointment </STRONG> :: 268 :: This movie is worth the cost of a Red Box rental.

It doesnt match up with other films based on this saga from the past. The story line gets lost and jumps around a bit. The 3D and effects in this film doesnt come close to AVITAR.

Ish. </STRONG> :: 280 :: Ray Harryhausens brand of fantasy was very much to my taste.Harryhausen was cutting edge at the time, but the cutting edge hasmoved on and I have long wondered what would be the results ifHarryhausens films were to be revisited using state of the art CGI.Now we have the answer.This film, though quite clearly based on Harryhausens original, playsfast and loose with some elements of it but, since the original playedfast and loose with myth (both versions feature the Kraken, from Norsemyth, for instance) I dont suppose one can complain too much.There are things to like and things to regard as less than wonderful.Things to like - the effects, for a starter. They are excellent.Mythological monsters have never looked so real. They have followedHarryhausens design for Medusa, but improved her by way of her havinga beautiful face. I would have welcomed her having some dialogue. RalphFiennes is a splendidly villainous Hades, Alexa Davalos works wonderswith a dismayingly underwritten Andromeda, and Gemma Artertoneffortlessly walks away with every scene she is in. Im glad the comedyowl from the original puts in an appearance, but Im even more gladthat it is no more than a 10 second cameo.On to the less positive aspects. The 3D adds nothing (as a major 3Dfan, it saddens me to say this - see How To Train Your Dragon in 3D,and this one flat). The constantly moving camera during actionsequences (Bourne syndrome) is dreadfully distracting. The story ismostly fine, although it loses something by having Perseus questdriven by anger rather than the need to save Andromeda - a bit ofromance would have been welcome. The script is no more thanserviceable. Most of the characters are pure cardboard, and SamWorthington brings no more to Perseus than Harry Hamlin did.Incidentally, I have noted people commenting that Sam Worthingtonsaccent slips from time to time and his natural Aussie shows through,but I dont think hes actually doing an accent - I think he is aunaturel throughout.If I am honest, the original Clash Of The Titans was essentially aninsubstantial romp with great monsters this remake is pretty much thesame. :: 281 :: James Kenworthy :: 282 :: 04 April 2010 :: 283 :: <STRONG> OK, But Not Great </STRONG> :: 284 :: Before I start this review, I must say that I hate action movies.Sorry, correction I despise action movies. The fight scenes are alwaysdragged out and takes up the majority of the movie. I wasnt initiallypleased to be dragged to see this movie, but it wasnt as bad as Ithought it was going to be. The movie itself was shorter than theaverage Hollywood blockbuster, at roughly 107 minutes long. The actionscenes werent as long as Id thought them to be and in fact were veryshort. I was happy with this but some hardcore action fans may find aproblem with this. So why am I only giving this a 510? The reason forthat is because the acting is very wooden here. Sam Worthington willhardly score an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Perseus and LiamNeesons Zeus leaves much to be desired ( although his wife did diebefore filming this movie, so it must have been hard on him ). Thescript was also weak here too, with not a lot of characters gettingmuch dialogue. By the way, before I finish up here, I noticed somethinginteresting I noticed that there was a hint of atheism during some ofthe scenes in Argos. I dont know was it intended but I thought itactually made the movie a bit more interesting. In conclusion its anOK movie to watch for passing time, but not if you want high qualityacting. :: 285 :: Dolores Bilderback :: 286 :: 03 April 2010 :: 287 :: <STRONG> I liked it! </STRONG> :: 288 :: I dont know what people are complaining about. After watching the original last week again, I wondered why I ever liked this movie to begin with. I will admit though, that it was great for the time. But I was falling asleep, graphics were horrible, and the cheese factor was off the charts. Then, after reading all these complaints I wasnt expecting much and came out saying Wow! I really liked it. The visuals were pretty awesome, especially the Kracken scene. I will admit there were some cheesy parts but there were even some scenes that made me laugh out loud which was totally unexpected, but loved it! I would definitely recommend this film. :: 289 :: Nancy Mcquade :: 290 :: 02 April 2010 :: 291 :: <STRONG> Really? </STRONG> :: 292 :: Dare I say it....this movie should have been 30 minutes longer. Then maybe people wouldnt pop in and out like bunny rabbits and there would have been some general flow to the film. 3D NOOOOO! There were more 3D effects in the previews for the OWL film then in the entire Clash of the Titans film, that was terrible and the other 3 people with me felt like they were cheated and scammed. There were several random lines that made no sense and were completely out of character. Then there was the terrible love story, if you can call a creeper following you around your whole life a love story.By the end I wished I was on Pegasus (The randomly appearing flying horse) in order to get out of the theater as fast as possible. :: 293 :: 	More Movies :: 294 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_373220.jpg :: 295 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 296 :: 	The Tourist (LQ) :: 297 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 298 :: 	Action, Thriller, Drama :: 299 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_372524.jpg :: 300 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 301 :: 	TRON: Legacy (LQ) :: 302 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 303 :: 	Action, Thriller, Adventure :: 304 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_367011.jpg :: 305 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 306 :: 	The Warrior's Way (LQ) :: 307 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 308 :: 	Action, Fantasy, Western :: 309 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_365406.jpg :: 310 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 311 :: 	Faster (LQ) :: 312 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 313 :: 	Action, Crime, Thriller :: 314 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_357188.jpg :: 315 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 316 :: 	Unstoppable :: 317 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 318 :: 	Action, Comedy, Drama :: 319 :: 	Copyright MoviesPlanet.com Â© 2002-2010 All Rights Reserved. :: 320 :: 	Support :: 321 :: 	/support.html :: 322 :: 	| :: 323 :: 	Privacy Policy :: 324 :: 	/privacy-policy.html :: 325 :: 	| :: 326 :: 	Terms of Use :: 327 :: 	/terms-of-use.html :: 328 :: 	| :: 329 :: 	FAQ :: 330 :: 	/faq.html :: 331 :: 	| :: 332 :: 	Help :: 333 :: 	/help.htm :: 334 :: 	Expand :: 335 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-clash-of-the-titans-2010-movie-6783.html# :: 336 :: 	next :: 337 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-clash-of-the-titans-2010-movie-6783.html# :: 338 :: 	previous :: 339 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-clash-of-the-titans-2010-movie-6783.html# :: 340 :: 	Close :: 341 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-clash-of-the-titans-2010-movie-6783.html# :: 342 :: 	Previous :: 343 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-clash-of-the-titans-2010-movie-6783.html# :: 344 :: 	0/0 :: 345 :: 	Next :: 346 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-clash-of-the-titans-2010-movie-6783.html# :: 347 ::

My only real problem is that the movie establishes the bad guys are experts good about their method of not being caught.So when TI gets out of jail has an obvious grudge against them, why do they buy into his plan? The rest of the bad guys are set to leave the country after they just got away with robbing a bank so why take the risk? This is the whole basis of the movie and it just doesnt make sense. Why would these criminal masterminds go against their plan of not being caught and do one more job with a guy they obviously dont trust?

Chris Brown did the damn thing in this movie. Team Breezy was all up in the theatre! LOL. He is such a great artist. Idris Elba, sexy as ever. Always love him. Native accent sexy as ever. Paul Walker and Hayden Christensen, oh my goodness...sexy! What! Besides the sexiness, yes, the movie was great. It was the best action packed movie Ive seen this year.

There is no thrill to this movieat all. Matt Dillion and Paul Welker made a bad choice trying to make acomeback with this movie. Jay Hernandezs death scene was ultra- cheesyand made me want to leave. Chris Browns action scenes were totallypredictable and you could tell there is a stunt man. And HaydenChritensen should of not been in this movie andor just stuck to beingAnakin Skywalker.

My friend who watched it with me choked on her popcorn from laughing so much. It has good performances from almost all the cast, especially Wahlberg and Ferrell. Mark W is suprisingly very funny-almost as funny as Will, and in some parts, funnier. I dont want to spoil too much about the movie. Its a buddy copbromance like Beverly Hills Cop would have been if John Ashton and Judge Reinhold were the stars instead of Eddie Murphy, because it isnt about the superstar cops. The two main characters played by Wahlberg and Ferrell were extremely likeable, and WahlbergFerrell have such good chemistry together that I enjoyed even the more serious parts of this movie. Honestly, I hope they do a sequel, because there is so much potential in the characters. Watch it and laugh. Its funny, sweet, silly, and exciting, with a rootable team of misfit cops who couldnt be more different. :: 260 :: Christopher Lyall :: 261 :: 11 August 2010 :: 262 :: <STRONG> Worst Movie of the Year </STRONG> :: 263 :: This may have been the worst movie I have ever seen.

But this time I got tricked into spending 2 stupid hours in the theater falling asleep. I was convinced by a news channel that this is a must see. The only part that I really enjoyed was the beginning with Jackson and Johnson in a lot of action. I really like Mark Wahlberg, but am very disappointed with his character for being just like Ferrell. The humor is corny and the story is so silly that I couldnt wait for the movie to end. If you want a good laugh, go see Despicable Me. :: 268 :: Andy Brown :: 269 :: 09 August 2010 :: 270 :: <STRONG> F YOU HOLLYWOOD </STRONG> :: 271 :: WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP! VERY BORING LONG AND UNFUNNY. AS A 28 YEAR OLD MALE I WAS EXCITED TO SEE THIS AFTER THE PREVIEW. WOW WHAT A MISTAKE. AFTER SAM AND THE ROCK DIE THE MOVIE IS A COMPLETE PIECE OF SHYYYTTTT. WILL IS GARBAGE. I LIKE HOW EVERYONE THINKS HE IS FUNNY. THAT IS NOT THE CASE. HE IS EASY TO REPLICATE BUT HE IS NOT FUNNY. KINDA LIKE WHEN A SIX YEAR OLD KEEPS SAYING AND DOING EVERYTHING YOU ARE. ITS EASY TO IMMATATE HARD TO BE FUNNY. SO WILL IS A PIECE OF SHYYYYIIITTTT. DINNER FOR SMUCKS IS WAAAAYYYYY BETTTTTTERRR. I LIKE HOW THEY HAVE TO USE MICHALE HEATON TO GET CHEAP LAUGHS. THAT THERE IS A CLUE TO THE TYOE OF ACTUAL HUMOR YOU GET. HOLLYWOOD CAN NOT WRITE A WELL SCRIPT THAT IS FUNNY. INSTEAD THEY TAKE A BEAT UP OLD IDEA OR PERSON AND TOSS THEM IN. F U HOLLYWOOD AND I AM PISSED THAT THIS MOVIE GOT RATED HIGH. ITS ALL ABOUT RQATING AND THE EXPERTS GET PAID. OR THE ARE INGSTUPID! :: 272 :: Patrick Gunn :: 273 :: 08 August 2010 :: 274 :: <STRONG> Definitely funny </STRONG> :: 275 :: Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg star as two loser cops in New York Citywho stumble upon a big case involving Steve Coogan as a corruptinvestment banker. Its very silly and very typical of a Will Ferrellcomedy, so you have to be a fan to have a reason to watch this. I am,and I enjoyed it. I wouldnt put it up there with his best films(Anchorman, Blades of Glory and Step Brothers, in my opinion), but itsdefinitely worth checking out. Wahlberg makes a nice partner. Hes veryfunny when he gets intense. Ferrell plays a more laid-back, nerdycharacter in this one. There are a lot of really funny gags. I loved,for instance, the whole running gag about Ferrell being able to attractwomen who should be far out of his league. Eva Mendes plays his wife,and near the beginning of the film Wahlberg meets her for the firsttime, attending a dinner at Ferrells place, and he cant even believeit. The film misses a lot of opportunities, too, partly because theyneeded to put out a PG-13 rated movie (I hope we get an unrateddirectors cut it might be a better film). But even stuff like thepartners rival cops (Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans Jr.(!?!?)), who feellike they should have been a bigger part of the film, doesnt get muchin the way of laughs. Michael Keaton has a decent role as the Captainwho also has a second job as manager of a Bed, Bath and Beyond so hisson can explore his bisexuality at NYU (a hilarious joke that reallyneeded to be explored just a tad more). The film ends with a downrightodd and out-of-place Power Point presentation of how investment bankersare defrauding America, set to a Rage Against the Machine song. Whoknew we were secretly watching a Michael Moore film? :: 276 :: Alana Leung :: 277 :: 07 August 2010 :: 278 :: <STRONG> worst opening scene in movie history </STRONG> :: 279 :: My wife and I walked out after only 15 minutes. An insult to anybody with an I.Q. over 60.Not funny with the absolute stupidest opening scene in movie history. Jackson must be back on crack and the Rock desperate to do anything.Ferrell as always sucks with few exceptions. Perhaps the movie got better but I would consider Vlad the Impalers torture than see any more of this unmitigated garbage . For complete simpletons only. Watch the supremely entertaining Kick-Ass a thousand times instead. You have been warned. Proceed at your own peril. :: 280 :: Tyler Moffett :: 281 :: 06 August 2010 :: 282 :: <STRONG> Very Random </STRONG> :: 283 :: The other guys had so many random moments. Some of them were pretty funny but there were others that just left you speechless and not in a funny way. But I enjoyed the movie overall. Ferrel will always be funny in whatever he is in, but he does tend to run the joke into the ground a bit. :: 284 :: 	More Movies :: 285 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_373220.jpg :: 286 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 287 :: 	The Tourist (LQ) :: 288 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 289 :: 	Action, Thriller, Drama :: 290 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_372524.jpg :: 291 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 292 :: 	TRON: Legacy (LQ) :: 293 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 294 :: 	Action, Thriller, Adventure :: 295 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_367011.jpg :: 296 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 297 :: 	The Warrior's Way (LQ) :: 298 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 299 :: 	Action, Fantasy, Western :: 300 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_365406.jpg :: 301 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 302 :: 	Faster (LQ) :: 303 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 304 :: 	Action, Crime, Thriller :: 305 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_357188.jpg :: 306 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 307 :: 	Unstoppable :: 308 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 309 :: 	Action, Comedy, Drama :: 310 :: 	Copyright MoviesPlanet.com Â© 2002-2010 All Rights Reserved. :: 311 :: 	Support :: 312 :: 	/support.html :: 313 :: 	| :: 314 :: 	Privacy Policy :: 315 :: 	/privacy-policy.html :: 316 :: 	| :: 317 :: 	Terms of Use :: 318 :: 	/terms-of-use.html :: 319 :: 	| :: 320 :: 	FAQ :: 321 :: 	/faq.html :: 322 :: 	| :: 323 :: 	Help :: 324 :: 	/help.htm :: 325 :: 	Expand :: 326 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-the-other-guys-movie-9424.html# :: 327 :: 	next :: 328 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-the-other-guys-movie-9424.html# :: 329 :: 	previous :: 330 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-the-other-guys-movie-9424.html# :: 331 :: 	Close :: 332 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-the-other-guys-movie-9424.html# :: 333 :: 	Previous :: 334 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-the-other-guys-movie-9424.html# :: 335 :: 	0/0 :: 336 :: 	Next :: 337 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-the-other-guys-movie-9424.html# :: 338 ::

Some of these 3D movies dont really have that many scenes in 3D that make it worth it. If I counted all the eye grabbing effects I saw in the movie it wouldnt come out to more than 5-(at best)10 minutes of screen time out of the whole movie. The story and pacing is decant with all the action helping it blend together well. Towards the end of the movie the action and the plot kind of bottle neck together leaving you with a semi-dissatisfaction with the overall writhing of the movie. At least there is enough fighting and explosions to make you feel like your not leaving too empty handed. In between the credits there is a scene that will makes fans happy knowing there might be a sequel, it just makes me wonder how much worse a plot can get before people just realize its a bunch of fight scenes with nothing to keep you interested but the next explosion. :: 283 :: Winona Wooden :: 284 :: 09 September 2010 :: 285 :: <STRONG> Awesome movie, BUT lacked in some areas </STRONG> :: 286 :: First of all let me state I am a die hard resident evil fan and have been following it since the release of the first game. This movie played wesker in the perfect light suited for him, evil and powerful. Next, the action scenes were amazing...the camera angles, slow motion, music, and attention to detail were insane. Also, you really got the creepy state of the art feel of umbrella that has been somewhat lacking in the previous films. There were only a couple disappointments -Chris lacked character development and needed a much better back story. Not only that but you really didnt get the feel of the true Chris. -At the conclusion, when Chris encounters Wesker...there was no emotion or suspense showing that the two really never encountered each other which is of up most importance because that means a lot in the game. What confuses me is when Wesker says How nice, a family reunion yet you really dont see how they know each other. -Finally, Weskers supposedly death...if the game runs true he will be back...but if that is the end of him, then his death was rather weak for his character. BUT the battle scene before was very intense and amazing. Overall great movie with the updated 3D technology, better adaptations of the game, but still lacked in some areas that are needed to stay true to the game and carry over to the movie. :: 287 :: 	More Movies :: 288 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_373220.jpg :: 289 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 290 :: 	The Tourist (LQ) :: 291 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 292 :: 	Action, Thriller, Drama :: 293 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_372524.jpg :: 294 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 295 :: 	TRON: Legacy (LQ) :: 296 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 297 :: 	Action, Thriller, Adventure :: 298 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_367011.jpg :: 299 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 300 :: 	The Warrior's Way (LQ) :: 301 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 302 :: 	Action, Fantasy, Western :: 303 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_365406.jpg :: 304 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 305 :: 	Faster (LQ) :: 306 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 307 :: 	Action, Crime, Thriller :: 308 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_357188.jpg :: 309 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 310 :: 	Unstoppable :: 311 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 312 :: 	Action, Comedy, Drama :: 313 :: 	Copyright MoviesPlanet.com Â© 2002-2010 All Rights Reserved. :: 314 :: 	Support :: 315 :: 	/support.html :: 316 :: 	| :: 317 :: 	Privacy Policy :: 318 :: 	/privacy-policy.html :: 319 :: 	| :: 320 :: 	Terms of Use :: 321 :: 	/terms-of-use.html :: 322 :: 	| :: 323 :: 	FAQ :: 324 :: 	/faq.html :: 325 :: 	| :: 326 :: 	Help :: 327 :: 	/help.htm :: 328 :: 	Expand :: 329 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-resident-evil-afterlife-movie-10185.html# :: 330 :: 	next :: 331 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-resident-evil-afterlife-movie-10185.html# :: 332 :: 	previous :: 333 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-resident-evil-afterlife-movie-10185.html# :: 334 :: 	Close :: 335 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-resident-evil-afterlife-movie-10185.html# :: 336 :: 	Previous :: 337 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-resident-evil-afterlife-movie-10185.html# :: 338 :: 	0/0 :: 339 :: 	Next :: 340 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-resident-evil-afterlife-movie-10185.html# :: 341 ::

While thats somewhat true, it really doesnt lower the films quality whatsoever. I think the problem was that too many people WANTED to dislike this, but if you just take it for what it is, which is an awesome B-movie and just try to be entertained, you might enjoy it. That is, if you like the first two Predator movies. Coming from a huge fan of both original movies, Predators does the franchise justice. The characters are nothing like the ones in the AVP movies, in a sense that you actually care about who dies. There isnt a substantial amount of development on every character, but the ones that grow the most throughout the film are the best ones to watch. Is Brody Arnold? Not really, but he does make a good performance here. One of the coolest things the film introduces to the series, is essentially a new breed of super kick-ass Predators. I really liked how they captured the suspense, tension and fear that the original Predator conveyed in the first movie, especially in the first act. Its not perfect by any means but its still pretty epic. I would give it an 8.5 or 9 on a 10 scale, a good score compared to the AVP films. Watch it for yourself and you be the judge. :: 257 :: Patricia Riggleman :: 258 :: 13 July 2010 :: 259 :: <STRONG> Predators </STRONG> :: 260 :: Huge fan of the the Predator franchise but fear they might have finally killed it off with this extremely poor and unimaginative offering. The only solace may be in the probable hefty hacking it received to get a 15 Rating but I doubt that an Editors cut would improve this much at all. :: 261 :: Christopher Gale :: 262 :: 12 July 2010 :: 263 :: <STRONG> Predators has its moments </STRONG> :: 264 :: Predators is a good action flick, but at times, it can sort of drag.The acting is very good. Better than most of these kind of films.Adrien Brody finds himself in the jungle again for the second timeafter King Kong. He and seven other prey are parachuted onto an alienplanet for game hunting by the Predators. The prey all stick togetherto try and find a way off the planet before they all become trophies.The violence in Predators is more extreme than the previous films. Itwas produced by Rodrigez who made Dusk till Dawn, the vampire flick,and also the upcoming Machete. So you know for sure there is a goodamount of bloodshed and gore. This is more of a guy movie, but Im surethere are girls who are into this stuff too besides Twilight. One ofthe best scenes is when the prey have alien like dogs sent after them.It is one of the most thrilling scenes in the movie. And you never knowwhich person is going to be the next to die, so at least it isnt toopredictable. I honestly didnt think Brody would be a good choice as anaction hero, but he surprised me in this one. The guy kicks major ass,especially towards the end. He is definitely not a wimp. All in all, Ithink you will have a good time with Predators. It can be fun to watchwhen it isnt being too draggy. Im sure it will be a great video game. :: 265 :: Sharon Anderson :: 266 :: 11 July 2010 :: 267 :: <STRONG> IT WAS JUST OKAY!! </STRONG> :: 268 :: Nothing really blew me away except to see the way the planets were lined up. This movie wasnt terrible but it wasnt fascinating either. I was hoping to see the characters display some sort of unique fighting abilities but nope, nothing, nada, zilch. That to me was the ultimate let down. :: 269 :: Jennifer Farmer :: 270 :: 10 July 2010 :: 271 :: <STRONG> wwweeell... </STRONG> :: 272 :: This movie.. oye. Wait till it comes out on DVD. Ill admit that the visuals are really great but the movie was kinda disappointing. It was actually kind of boring. Not that many action scenes, mostly just walking around and finding weird things and blah blah blah. Compared to the other predator movies, this one was lame. Especially some of the lines that the actors said.... specifically Laurence Fishburne, he was just a crack-up! I mean wow. Overall, I say save your money and wait till you can rent it. :: 273 :: Micheal Stewart :: 274 :: 09 July 2010 :: 275 :: <STRONG> Almost Perfect homage to the original A+ sequal </STRONG> :: 276 :: BY FAR THE BEST of any sequal and I use that term loosely. The original is in my opinion the best BUT this Predators is a perfect extension of the mythos, and leaves you wanting and expecting more. This films pays homage to the orignal in both production and dialogue. Any Predator fan will know exactly which lines and which scenes tip their hats to the original. Much like Alien and Aliens this movie almost flawlessly ties in and takes the original and itself to the next level. The Cast is great and Adrien Brody does a FANTASTIC JOB. I will say that I was a bit shocked my Lawrence Fishburn...hes let himelf go and its tough to see him that way...BUT he nails his character. Most of the production was shot in a jungle much like the original. You see familiar sights but it also feels alien. One scene was shot like a Kurosawa movie and perhaps a bit heavy handed, however it still worked. One thing I felt that was lacking was the surprise in the characters when they find out they are on another planet. I mean I gotta say...I might be a little shocked. These guys just push on and really dont acknowledge it. ALso that chick in the film has a sniper rifle and seems to always have to look through the scope even at things 10 ft away. IT was a little annoying. To me these are the only flaws in the film. Honestly thats not saying a whole lot. The movie moves fast and keeps your attention. Some of the action scenes are a bit jumpy and hard to follow but thats rare. Ultimately this is a FUN RIDE and a great movie for Predator fans and new ones...see Predator if you havent then see this one...you can skip Predator 2. However there maybe some revelation that ties into P2...and that is something that Fishburns Character says about there being 2 types of Predators. :: 277 :: 	More Movies :: 278 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_373220.jpg :: 279 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 280 :: 	The Tourist (LQ) :: 281 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 282 :: 	Action, Thriller, Drama :: 283 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_372524.jpg :: 284 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 285 :: 	TRON: Legacy (LQ) :: 286 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 287 :: 	Action, Thriller, Adventure :: 288 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_367011.jpg :: 289 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 290 :: 	The Warrior's Way (LQ) :: 291 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 292 :: 	Action, Fantasy, Western :: 293 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_365406.jpg :: 294 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 295 :: 	Faster (LQ) :: 296 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 297 :: 	Action, Crime, Thriller :: 298 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_357188.jpg :: 299 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 300 :: 	Unstoppable :: 301 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 302 :: 	Action, Comedy, Drama :: 303 :: 	Copyright MoviesPlanet.com Â© 2002-2010 All Rights Reserved. :: 304 :: 	Support :: 305 :: 	/support.html :: 306 :: 	| :: 307 :: 	Privacy Policy :: 308 :: 	/privacy-policy.html :: 309 :: 	| :: 310 :: 	Terms of Use :: 311 :: 	/terms-of-use.html :: 312 :: 	| :: 313 :: 	FAQ :: 314 :: 	/faq.html :: 315 :: 	| :: 316 :: 	Help :: 317 :: 	/help.htm :: 318 :: 	Expand :: 319 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-predators-2010-movie-8697.html# :: 320 :: 	next :: 321 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-predators-2010-movie-8697.html# :: 322 :: 	previous :: 323 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-predators-2010-movie-8697.html# :: 324 :: 	Close :: 325 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-predators-2010-movie-8697.html# :: 326 :: 	Previous :: 327 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-predators-2010-movie-8697.html# :: 328 :: 	0/0 :: 329 :: 	Next :: 330 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-predators-2010-movie-8697.html# :: 331 ::

A couple of beers would help your appreciation ofthis fine cinematic masterpiece. Hey, any movie with a psych ward cantbe all bad. While different from the original, this reinterpretation of thematerial is true to the spirit of the original. The roles are wellcast. Some mention has been made of the fact that in the TV series, in spiteof egregious gunfire, no one ever died. I consider it a good thing thatthe movie portrays guns as dangerous weapons. :: 247 :: Maria Berta :: 248 :: 03 July 2010 :: 249 :: <STRONG> Critics be damned </STRONG> :: 250 :: A-Team was a good entertaining action movie. It did not break any new ground for action movies and the story was predictable, but it was a fun time at the movies. Isnt this why any of us go to the movies in the first place? To be entertained. Rampage as BA was surprisingly good and the other actors looked like they had a hoot making the movie and they enjoyed the characters they were playing. I had a fun time watching this movie, but unfortunately I dont think there will be a sequal. From this movie, I think Bradley Cooper should have been the Green Lantern instead of Ryan Reynolds. :: 251 :: Diana Hickson :: 252 :: 02 July 2010 :: 253 :: <STRONG> Fabulous </STRONG> :: 254 :: This movie was a delight to fans of the original series. However, for people not familiar with the TV series, this movie does it all. Okay so this is not brain surgery 101. It is not trying to be something its not. Stephen J. Cannell penned a masterful script. No one else could have done it, but him. And while the new voices and faces of the A-Team stayed true to the original, they added their own flourishes and nuances to make the movie new. :: 255 :: Melissa Peppers :: 256 :: 30 June 2010 :: 257 :: <STRONG> Movie After The Series </STRONG> :: 258 :: I think the movie is a little better than the series, the movie is more realistic and not as flashy, :: 259 :: Wayne Evans :: 260 :: 27 June 2010 :: 261 :: <STRONG> Good acting discouraging story </STRONG> :: 262 :: Its a good movie, not great! The actors are all brilliant especially Nissen and Biel! Good direction, and excellent combination of comedy and drama. No happy end but there is a hope at the end of the tunnel, not all are corrupted even the system failed those who fight for good. Kept us interested all the time and we enjoyed the movie - that is what matter... :: 263 :: Thomas Nance :: 264 :: 16 June 2010 :: 265 :: <STRONG> True to devoted fans! </STRONG> :: 266 :: We were pleasantly surprised by how close to the tv series this stayed. What a well done movie! we loved it!! :: 267 :: Kelly Wilson :: 268 :: 15 June 2010 :: 269 :: <STRONG> I love it when a plan comes together </STRONG> :: 270 :: The acting is top notch. These guys deserve to make more movies together. Watch out Bond and Bourne, the A-Team is taking over. The effects are incredible and are helped by excellent editing. I loved it when the old theme song is playing and the Hummer busts through the wall. The only weak link is the story which considering the original subject, you wonder why the characters go to all the trouble. But once it turns into revenge mode, look-out. I only wish the original A-Team actors wouldve been in the movie itself instead of being tacked on at the end. Brian Bloom makes a great new bad guy. I hope this can actually turn into a series of movies that can rival Bond and Bourne. It was a far better movie then Ironman 2. :: 271 :: Janice Collins :: 272 :: 14 June 2010 :: 273 :: <STRONG> Bring back the show </STRONG> :: 274 :: Really enjoyed it, didnt even miss the original actors. All the actors made it like watching the original tv actors but with better effects. They had a plan when they made this and Love a plan when it comes together. :: 275 :: Victoria Hogan :: 276 :: 13 June 2010 :: 277 :: <STRONG> yes indeed!!!! </STRONG> :: 278 :: Everything from the beginning was awesome... The action, the plot, EVERYTHING!!! Rampage did a great job with his acting as well. I was hoping that he didnt do a horrible job.... Anyone that doesnt like this has serious issues.

Wahoo!! It was such a fun movie. I loved it. I hope theres a sequel. It is fun. Go see it. :: 283 :: Zack Coleman :: 284 :: 11 June 2010 :: 285 :: <STRONG> The A-Team. (what a movie) </STRONG> :: 286 :: I gotta say, I went to this movie having grown up watching the T.Vshow. and I wasnt disappointed. The humor was there, the craziness wasthere and even Quinton Rampage Jackson who had some pretty big shoesto fill (starring as the Iconic B.A Baracus) did a brilliant job. LiamNeeson was great. (although I havent really seen a movie with him init that I didnt like) Bradley Cooper did a good job (and it was niceto see him back in an action role.) Sharlto Copley was great asMurdock. (And absolutely hilarious.) and Jessica Biel and PatrickWilson really rounded the cast out. When it came to the action scenes,they were brilliantly done, I would have to say my favorite scene wasthe Tank Parachute scene and there wasnt a moment where I wasnt gluedto the screen or laughing my head off. I have to say I hope they do asequel. I would definitely recommend this movie to all fans of theoriginal series and even those who are being introduced to it for thefirst time. :: 287 :: Stephen Turner :: 288 :: 10 June 2010 :: 289 :: <STRONG> A Great Tribute to the Original </STRONG> :: 290 :: Great movie. Unlike other 80s remakes the creators did a great job sticking to the premise of the original show with a 2010 slant. The entire cast was great, but Cooper and Copley steal the show. The mixture of comedy, action and fun makes for an extremely entertaining film. Yes, reality is often suspended and the creators did not spend a great deal of time on character development, but again, thats exactly what the original show was about. In 1984 it was about building a tank that shoots heads of cabbage at bad guys, in 2010 its about flying a tank. The movie is worth your time and will I suspect enjoy many, many years on FX and Spike down the road. There also is at least an opening for a sequel. :: 291 :: Patricia Schilling :: 292 :: 08 June 2010 :: 293 :: <STRONG> The best film you could ask for from an A-Team adaptation </STRONG> :: 294 :: If any film demands to be graded on a curve, its The A-Team. Simply consider the notion of making a big-budget summer movie from ofone of the cheesiest television shows of a cheesy TV era. Its a crafty plan to lower your expectations. As long the movie isnttwo hours of punching grandmothers and kicking puppies, youre likelyto leave the theater saying, That was better than I expected. Guess what? It works like a charm. The A-Team, against all odds, is one extremely entertaining film. Itputs pedal to metal about 90 seconds in and never lets up. Thats alsosavvy because its also kind of a mess that would collapse under itsown weight if it slowed down for more than two minutes. Director Joe Carnahan (Smokin Aces, Narc) isnt taking that chance.Action scenes come flying at you hard and heavy from start to finish.The results are mixed Some sequences are choppy and confusing, othersthrilling. But like a comedy that never stops pitching jokes, contentif only half of them stick, The A-Team pitches action, action, action,with a side of action and a little action to wash it down. The plot follows the general concept of the TV series with a fewtweaks. A (very) lengthy credits sequence set in Mexico shows us howthe team of former Army Rangers comes together Leader John HannibalSmith (Liam Neeson), his right-hand man Templeton Face Peck (BradleyCooper), powerful Bosco B.A. Baracus (Quinton Rampage Jackson) andloony pilot James Howling Mad Murdock (Sharlto Copley). We jump ahead several years, where the A-Team is now an Army covertoperations crew with dozens of successful missions under their belts.But when theyre set up for a fall by a variety of villainous forces,the boys have to break out of jail and fight to clear their names. Thats pretty much all you wanted to know about the plot, right?Because it gets pretty confusing from there and doesnt matter in theslightest anyway. Its only there to support ? thats right ? action. Before I tell you why A-Team is worth your hard-earned cash, I shouldlay out its many faults. Though Carnahan directed, its not surprising to see director TonyScott was one of the producers. Too many scenes evince Scotts look ?the camera shoved in way too tight on the actors, so you cant tellwhat the hells going on in fight scenes or big gun battles. The special effects are wildly uneven too, especially in the climax. Itlooks like the usual Hollywood problem of the CGI being just goodenough to make a locked-in release date. This time, its nowhere neargood enough. But then, The A-Team is a nitpickers dream, if you really want to gothere. Jessica Biels casting seems like an inside joke ? were nottaking this seriously, and neither should you, so lets cast a gorgeousbut astonishingly wooden actor in this role. Maybe youre wondering whether shes really that bad. Look at it thisway This is the first major film role for Rampage Jackson, an MMAfighter. Hes not great, but hes not too bad ? and thats high praisefor a non-actor stepping into the iconic role. Yet hes a good bit morebelievable than Biel. So with those issues, what makes The A-Team so entertaining? The restof the cast, actually. If you can look past Biel (actually, look rightat her, thats what shes there for), the film is jam-packed withcolorful, charismatic performances. Neeson seems a bit odd at first stepping into George Peppards shoes asHannibal, being considerably taller, leaner and tougher. But thatsappropriate for the movie, which is basically the TV show on (lots andlots of) steroids. No attempt is made to explain his Irish accent, northat of Copley, who is South African. It doesnt matter Somehow inthis film, it works. But the film decides early on to focus on Cooper, hot off his successin The Hangover, and its the right choice. Youd never have guessedthe guy who played eighth fiddle on Alias would be front-and-center fora star-making performance, but its true. The A-Team shows off Coopers buffed-up physique almost to the point ofabsurdity ? hes shirtless on screen more than Mark Wahlberg in DateNight ? but Coopers charisma carries the day throughout. A well-rounded supporting cast also delivers. Patrick Wilson and BrianBloom, as potentially shady characters related to the A-Teamstroubles, steal every scene theyre in. (It probably doesnt hurt thatBloom, a veteran actor mostly relegated to TV work, gets co-writingcredit.) Their wonderfully brash characters bring welcome levity to thepounding machine of gunfights and explosions that propels The A-Team. Finally, I would be remiss if I didnt note the drinking game that byall rights should be born from this film Drink whenever a guy with icyblue eyes is on screen. Youd pass out halfway through the film. Theres Cooper and Neeson alone, plus Bloom and Wilson, with a littleGerald McRaney ? yes, Major Dad himself ? thrown in for good measure. If youre really into dudes with bright blue eyes, The A-Team is likeporn. If youre into nonstop action and lots of male bonding, TheA-Team is like porn. If youre into deep, fully-realized femalecharacters ? well, look elsewhere. But if you had to ask me what I would want a big-screen take on areally silly TV show to be, The A-Team more than fits the bill. Itsridiculous, sure.

In 13th century England, Robin and his band of marauders confront corruption in a local village and lead an uprising against the crown that will forever alter the balance of world power. And whether thief or hero, one man from humble beginnings will become an eternal symbol of freedom for his people. Robin Hood chronicles the life of an expert archer, previously interested only in self-preservation, from his service in King Richards army against the French. Upon Richards death, Robin travels to Nottingham, a town suffering from the corruption of a despotic sheriff and crippling taxation, where he falls for the spirited widow Lady Marian (Oscar winner Cate Blanchett), a woman skeptical of the identity and motivations of this crusader from the forest. Hoping to earn the hand of Maid Marian and salvage the village, Robin assembles a gang whose lethal mercenary skills are matched only by its appetite for life. Together, they begin preying on the indulgent upper class to correct injustices under the sheriff. With their country weakened from decades of war, embattled from the ineffective rule of the new king and vulnerable to insurgencies from within and threats from afar, Robin and his men heed a call to ever greater adventure. This unlikeliest of heroes and his allies set off to protect their country from slipping into bloody civil war and return glory to England once more.

A lot of audiences hated this movie. I have no idea why. The combination of Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett could make paint drying fascinating. There is not a poor acting job in this film, the script was solid, the story was compelling and it was directed well. Seriously, what more do you want?? Go into the movie with a willing suspension of disbelief and dont compare it with any movie youve seen before about Robin Hood because thats not what this movie is and you will enjoy it. I think we have all just seen to many movies that we forget how to enjoy the ones with merit without being groundbreaking. Ridley Scotts vision for Robin Hood is well-executed, well-acted, and well-directed. Enjoy it while knowing its not going to change your life. :: 253 :: Michael Murray :: 254 :: 31 May 2010 :: 255 :: <STRONG> Robin Longstride Striding Long Indeed +++ </STRONG> :: 256 :: I like many aspects of this refreshingly earthy gritty variant of the various Robin Hood sagas. The motion and emotion are entrancing -- with some good humor to balance the many grim era-settings -- such as the Norman French landing-craft coming FROM Normandy for the last battle -- much like the ones that went TO there more recently WW II. The settings are very historically realistic Norman Medieval including Celtic and Saxon aspects. Being a longtime fan of the Middle Ages -- I am very pleasantly surprised at the many spot-on correct details. For example -- the realistic swords -- and swordplay with foul close-combat moves such as pommel-slams, head-butts, heel-trips and grappling -- much as in the Fectbuchs fight-books originating from Medieval experience. Then theres the pick-axes and bill-hooks used by calvary to remove footmen and vice versa. The staves, spears and lances drive home their points accurately. The longbows depicted are not fancy-fantasy ones -- but in their stark yew-wood reality. Robin Longstride Russel Crowe spent months learning about Robin Hood and his Norman Medieval setting -- and gained true skill with the longbow by-the-way. The siege equipment on both sides is quite real -- such as missle-weapons, shield-walls, hook-ladders, drop-stones, boil-pots and fire-bags. The other artifacts and usages such as tools, plows, and winches are spot-on. The castles and other dwellings are great in their lush greenwood settings. The production goes well into historical food, drink, manners and customs in those settings -- like the ring-dancing of Robin and Marion. The churches, castles, chapels, manors, houses and lands are incredibly historical -- as well as are the customs of the folks who live in these settings -- such as Lady Marion Cate Blanchett -- who gives a splendidly spirited presentation of the eventual partner of Robin Longstride -- these two leading a great number of excellent actors and acts to initiate the viewer into a GRAPHIC MEDIEVAL EXPANDED SAGA OF ROBIN LONGSTRIDE HOOD. Great when this movie and its sequels are on DVD +++ :: 257 :: Mary Wooten :: 258 :: 30 May 2010 :: 259 :: <STRONG> What I expected </STRONG> :: 260 :: I went into this movie with an open mind. From the trailers and previews, I had no expectations that this was going to follow in the footsteps of classic Robin Hood movies of old. And Scotts Robin Hood delivered. It was a different interpretation that fascinated me and kept me involved throughout. The interweaving of historical characters, like Phillip of France and Richard with the mythical Robin was a delight. For those of you who, like Roger Ebert, cant seem to fathom a different take on the classic tale, you would be wise to avoid this film. But to those of you who want to view a well known meme in a different light, well acted and directed, then this is a movie you would probably enjoy. :: 261 :: George Armstrong :: 262 :: 28 May 2010 :: 263 :: <STRONG> The worst Robin Hood movie ever </STRONG> :: 264 :: This movie is so overlong and boring I almost fell asleep severaltimes. Of course it was never going to be good anyway because all theactors are far too old. I just dont understand why they cast an ugly46-year-old fat thug like Crowe with his huge beer gut and horridgravel voice as Robin Hood. Errol Flynn will always be the best, atleast he was only 28, athletic and actually sounded English.41-year-old Cate Blanchett looks as ugly as sin, is far too old to playMaid Marian, and unsurprisingly has zero chemistry with Crowe. Itwould have been so much better if they had cast younger, British actorslike Christian Bale and Robin and Keira Knightley as Marian instead ofa far too old Crowe and Blanchett. 010. Dont bother, just buy the Errol Flynn masterpiece. :: 265 :: Christopher Schaeffer :: 266 :: 26 May 2010 :: 267 :: <STRONG> Robin Hood </STRONG> :: 268 :: Robin Hood was ok, but it definitely doesnt even come close to being as good as its known predecessors. The movie is pretty weak overall. The acting isnt too good here, and Russell Crowe was miscast as the heroic outlaw because of his old age. This is supposed to be the origin story. Robin Hood isnt supposed to be old enough to be King Philips father! This isnt a bad movie, for it is watchable, but dont go out of your way to see it. Rent the 1938 classic instead. Thats a real movie. :: 269 :: Earl Ogden :: 270 :: 24 May 2010 :: 271 :: <STRONG> WHAT?????????? </STRONG> :: 272 :: With all that is known about Robin Hood, this movie is a definate disappointment.You watch the whole movie waiting for Robin to steal from the rich and give to the poor. The story line sucks. The movie is not good. :: 273 :: Annie Mays :: 274 :: 23 May 2010 :: 275 :: <STRONG> Very entertaining! </STRONG> :: 276 :: I want to say firstly that I hated Gladiator, so if I make anycomparisons at all with this film it is against the other RH films TV series that have gone before. Having read seen some of thePlantagenet 12th13th century history I found this story to be closeenough to the historical mark to be very believable. One reviewer asked why we didnt know what happened to King Johnsfirst wife? The answer was in the film! Johns stated intention ofhaving that marriage annulled so he could marry Isabella was in factwhat happened. It actually paid to have a few clues about this part ofEnglish history. The English barons did finally force John to sign theGreat Charter in 1215, which he then went back on his word (with thePopes agreement). Could Maid Marion have worn armour- well Joan of Arcdid 200 years later.. I found this to be a very entertaining, a well spun yarn, well cast great acting by all, and at times some stunning locationsphotography.Did this look like early 13th century England? Yes more so that in anyother films I have seen in the past. I think it stands as the bestRobin Hood film to date Im ready for the next one. 1010 :: 277 :: Benny Shephard :: 278 :: 22 May 2010 :: 279 :: <STRONG> Street Cred </STRONG> :: 280 :: The life of Robin Hood is, of course, a vague legend. It concerns an outlawed man who fights for the downtrodden in Englands midlands in the 13th century. It is a story that has been reworked many times both on television and in film. In this case, we have Ridley Scott reprising the story with Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett in the starring roles as Robin and Marion. The plot used for this film is arguably implausible. Robin has returned from the Crusades (scarcely one of Christendoms high points) and passes himself off as a man of wealth in Nottingham. He sees the injustice of King John and his heavy handed taxes. In due course, he is forced to be an outlaw and, thus, the legend is born. Crowe and Blanchett are good in their respective roles. However, it is the grandeur and scale of the scenes that really capture the viewers attention. These are truly magnificent. Yet what really excels is the grittiness of the scenes. The castles seem dirty but very believable. There are no Disney type scenes here. Ridley Scott has managed to capture the times well. All too often, films of the middle ages are simply too clean. Here, Robin Hood has cred. So, how to sum up? Well, it a good film without being a great film. Two hours well spent. :: 281 :: Arlene Walters :: 282 :: 20 May 2010 :: 283 :: <STRONG> Snooze Fest Sequel to Gladiator </STRONG> :: 284 :: Zzzzzzzz. Just saw it last night. Yes, Virginia, there is onedimensional film. With the exception of Max von Sydow (OMG, he was oldin Three Days of the Condor and that was and that was in 1975!) theacting was about as flat as Twiggys chest. Wake up, Russell! A littlemore vim in those sawed off words! Smile once, Cate! Sherwood Forestwont go up in flames. The version with Errol Flynn is still the mostfun. The one with Uma the most enthralling. The one I saw last night,the best cure for insomnia! And JFC, he wasnt called Robin Hoodbecause he was Robin of the hood. RH isnt the frigging Green Arrow,and he didnt grow up in the hood. His name was Robert Hodd and RobinHood was a nickname. I was just disappointed that Russell didnt crowout, I am Maximus Hood. Now, that would have made a bland moviegreat. :: 285 :: Debra Beaulieu :: 286 :: 19 May 2010 :: 287 :: <STRONG> Bulls in the China Shop </STRONG> :: 288 :: Ive seen about 4 or 5 Robin Hood movies. My favorite remains the Errol Flynn 1939 version. How does the Robin Hood legend go? The good King Richard goes off to fight honorably and nobly in the Crusades. His evil brother John usurps the throne and exploits the people. Robin of Loxley, the son of a noble landowner, opposes the evil tyranny of the imposter King John. Robin does not oppose the monarchy and remains loyal to the good King Richard. King John outlaws Robin for his opposition to cruely and tyranny, so Robin and his band of outlaws fight for the peoples rights and against King John. The good King Richard is returning from the crusade and King John plans to assinate so John can continue his cruel reign. Robin fights to save the good King Richard and restore him to the thone. The good King rules again and the evil King and his evil henchmen die or are banished from England. So, WHAT is this new Robin Hood story? Anti-royalist? Revolutionary? Lions versus Lambs? My youthful dreams of saving the world are over. The world dont wanna be saved. Lambs are lambs and lions are lions. If lamb became lions the we wouldnt have any lambs. I like lambs better than lions. So kill me you stinkin lions! :: 289 :: Lee Watson :: 290 :: 18 May 2010 :: 291 :: <STRONG> Great to see Russell Crowe back in action as yummy historical hero. </STRONG> :: 292 :: Basically Ill keep it short and to the point... Been reading A lot ofthese very lengthy reviews about this film..wow theyre long and dull..This film is without a doubt one of the best Ive seen in a long timeand as a HUGE Russell Crowe fan it was wonderful to see him in the roleof Robin Hood, being all manly and sexy again...sigh. Love the scenewhere lady Marion has to help him off with his chain mail and we ladiesget that much needed look at Russell bare chested..sigh and CateBlanchett was the perfect choice for Lady Marion, what chemistrybetween them as well.. Overall I thought this film was a breath offresh air, finally a more or less historically correct tale of eventsin England during very hard times in the 12th century. It stars abrilliant Kiwi born actor who can do the accent properly alongside acast of extremely talented people... bar Prince John..did not convinceme in that role and I kept thinking of Edmund Blackadder.. RowanAtkinson would have been a better choice for the role. Fantastic film, cant wait to own it on DVD and watch it numeroustimes!! Well done RidleyRussell!! :: 293 :: Jesse Mccall :: 294 :: 17 May 2010 :: 295 :: <STRONG> ScottCrowes epic origin story re-boot is just that epic </STRONG> :: 296 :: ROBIN HOOD (2010) Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett, Max von Sydow,William Hurt, Mark Strong, Oscar Isaac, Danny Huston, Eileen Atkins,Mark Addy, Matthew Macfadyen, Kevin Durand, Scott Grimes, Alan Doyle,Douglas Hodge. Ridley Scotts epic origin story of the legendary folkhero gets a big boostre-boot for the 21st Century with Crowe as thearchersoldier who decides to fight the establishment (read KingJohn) and right the wrongs in the process. While the action sequencessuggest Saving Private Ryan meets Braveheart and the echoes ofScottCrowes Gladiator it still stands on it s own merits largelythanks to a streamlined script by Brian Helgeland and some impressiveset pieces (and a fine ensemble particularly a fierce Blanchett as MaidMarian) leading to a new franchise to explore therobber-of-the-rich-and-giver-to-the-poor. :: 297 :: Thelma Sykes :: 298 :: 16 May 2010 :: 299 :: <STRONG> THE MAN CAN SIT A HORSE! </STRONG> :: 300 :: Buy the popcorn, get comfortable, the computer graphics are a bit jerky, I am not sure about landing craft in the 13th century, that said It is good fun!. :: 301 :: Jeanette Welch :: 302 :: 15 May 2010 :: 303 :: <STRONG> Good movie </STRONG> :: 304 :: It is a movie that stands alone.

This movie was entertaining. :: 305 :: Jamie Swartz :: 306 :: 14 May 2010 :: 307 :: <STRONG> They had to call it something else </STRONG> :: 308 :: It was very good movie with all the big fighting scenes and good story. The only but here is that it is not the movie you expect to watch. Two out of 158 minutes are dedicated to real Robin Hood. The remaining is just the accompanying story. So if you really want to see Robin Hood story, dont spend your time. If you want just see a good epic movie, youll enjoy your time. :: 309 :: 	More Movies :: 310 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_373220.jpg :: 311 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 312 :: 	The Tourist (LQ) :: 313 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 314 :: 	Action, Thriller, Drama :: 315 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_372524.jpg :: 316 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 317 :: 	TRON: Legacy (LQ) :: 318 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 319 :: 	Action, Thriller, Adventure :: 320 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_367011.jpg :: 321 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 322 :: 	The Warrior's Way (LQ) :: 323 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 324 :: 	Action, Fantasy, Western :: 325 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_365406.jpg :: 326 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 327 :: 	Faster (LQ) :: 328 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 329 :: 	Action, Crime, Thriller :: 330 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_357188.jpg :: 331 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 332 :: 	Unstoppable :: 333 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 334 :: 	Action, Comedy, Drama :: 335 :: 	Copyright MoviesPlanet.com Â© 2002-2010 All Rights Reserved. :: 336 :: 	Support :: 337 :: 	/support.html :: 338 :: 	| :: 339 :: 	Privacy Policy :: 340 :: 	/privacy-policy.html :: 341 :: 	| :: 342 :: 	Terms of Use :: 343 :: 	/terms-of-use.html :: 344 :: 	| :: 345 :: 	FAQ :: 346 :: 	/faq.html :: 347 :: 	| :: 348 :: 	Help :: 349 :: 	/help.htm :: 350 :: 	Expand :: 351 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-robin-hood-movie-7305.html# :: 352 :: 	next :: 353 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-robin-hood-movie-7305.html# :: 354 :: 	previous :: 355 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-robin-hood-movie-7305.html# :: 356 :: 	Close :: 357 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-robin-hood-movie-7305.html# :: 358 :: 	Previous :: 359 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-robin-hood-movie-7305.html# :: 360 :: 	0/0 :: 361 :: 	Next :: 362 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-robin-hood-movie-7305.html# :: 363 ::

Opening moments were funny with Richard Dreyfus singing his want to go home song from Jaws, before becoming the first to be eaten alive. Elizabeth Shue has done far better things. Shes still a hottie, even in police uniform the entire time. Lots of excellent T A, which is the only excellence on screen. In gender fairness, we get to view the obnoxious guys chomped off penis being rejected in the water by our title characters. :: 252 :: James Sisson :: 253 :: 29 August 2010 :: 254 :: <STRONG> NOT SCARY!! </STRONG> :: 255 :: We went and watched this last night. I guess i was expecting JAWS or something like that but what we got was more of some kinda spoof of a scary movie. The 3D effects were terrible. It was more of a soft porn then anything. MOTHERS BEWARE Its filled with ALOT of graphic nudity. It was actually more funny then scary. We wound up laughing more than jumping. Jerry Oconnell was hallarious and the others acting wasnt THAT bad and I will give it this it was gross but even that sometimes came away as cheesy. :: 256 :: Richard Mitchell :: 257 :: 28 August 2010 :: 258 :: <STRONG> Worst movie in years, complete waste of my money </STRONG> :: 259 :: The special effects are so fake, its unbelievable.

I am out of 24 and I regret every dime. They got some well known actors in the movie like Richard Dreyfuss and Christopher Lloyd. Dont let that fool you, these actors must be stink broke and deeply in debt to have signed up with this dumb movie, making a few bucks. :: 260 :: Dennis Hunt :: 261 :: 27 August 2010 :: 262 :: <STRONG> Greatest movie ever? </STRONG> :: 263 :: Is this the greatest movie ever made?

They love going to horror movies. They said this was the worse they ever saw. If porn is your thing then this is your movie. Girl on girl. Nudity for 80 of the movie and 20 story. Sorry I cant tell you it is a good movie. :: 268 :: Robert Lightle :: 269 :: 23 August 2010 :: 270 :: <STRONG> I walked out and got a refund </STRONG> :: 271 :: This movie was too awful to be worth spending any amount of money on. Im guessing from the high volume of piranha related yahoo articles that are coming out everyday and the unusually high volume of positive reviews for this garbage, that the piranha advertising camp has been hard at work, cuz this movie freaking sucked. This was beyond campy, and I watch sci fi monster movies. For all you dumb parents out there, rated R means dont take your kids. For everyone else, if you have to see this movie, cuz you have absolutely nothing else in your life that you could possibly do isntead, then wait till this crap is free. :: 272 :: Patricia Myers :: 273 :: 22 August 2010 :: 274 :: <STRONG> Piranha 3D Good Movie? Hell No! </STRONG> :: 275 :: This movie was terrible the 3D was not even half way decent but the story and ending of the movie was pointless and absolutely terrible.

This movie for you. Truly bad :: 280 :: Mary Massenburg :: 281 :: 20 August 2010 :: 282 :: <STRONG> Fun 3D summer horror movie </STRONG> :: 283 :: I saw this movie earlier today. Its a very good 3D summer horror film filled with horny nude teens, laughs, some scares plenty of gore and amazing 3D special effects. In my opinion, this is one of the few very good summer movies out there thus far. If you are a big fan of 3D horror movies (remakes, reboots or otherwise), then this ones for you. :: 284 :: Richard Odonnell :: 285 :: 19 August 2010 :: 286 :: <STRONG> I dont know why people like it... </STRONG> :: 287 :: this is really disappointing movie i have ever had. its totally unrealistic, especially when then the cops are trying to stop the festival.

Once there, they meet with local rebel Sandra and discover the true nature of the conflict engulfing the city. When they escape the island and Sandra stays behind, Ross must choose to either walk away and save his own life - or attempt a suicidal rescue mission that might just save his soul. :: 212 :: 	Movie Photo :: 213 :: 	1-18	Daphne Garrity :: 250 :: 01 September 2010 :: 251 :: <STRONG> The biggest MAN movie thats been produced in years. </STRONG> :: 252 :: This movie contains nearly every single major male action star from thepast two decades. Im not talking suave like George Clooney, or crazylike Mel Gibson. Im talking gritty, hard-bitten, hardcore and allaround the manliest of men. This is a movie made for men. It sounds chauvinistic but its seriouslythe manliest movie ever made. Michael Bay has nothing on SylvesterStallone when it comes to downright gut rattling action and explosions. The plot is nothing to write home about and the dialogue at times seemsa bit forced. What I came to realize (after the movie finished) wasthat the forced dialogue AT the time detracted a bit from the movie,but with a second look I was able to realize it was more realistic thansome of the heroic one-liners you hear in a lot of action moviesnowadays. The camera work was great except for the emergency takeoff scene, itlooked like it was shot on two different days with two horriblydifferent lightings. All in all, this is the movie every rugged, square-jawed,gun-worshiping action nut has been waiting for. Could have used more Ahnald. :: 253 :: Irene Robinson :: 254 :: 17 August 2010 :: 255 :: <STRONG> So disappointing ... </STRONG> :: 256 :: When I saw previews for this, I was truly looking forward to it. There are movies that you MUST see on the big screen, and this was one of them. Was (my mistake), not is (your chance to avoid my mistake). There were a lot of problems with this movie - Jet Li needs more money, but we never find out why. What does Mickey Rourke do besides tattoos? Why does Dolph have to whisper into Stallones ear? Why doesnt the general kill the guy thats pushing him around? ... Batman already broke his legs. Where are all those bombs coming from? Everybodys running around planting bombs on everything, but nobodys wearing a backpack. Theres a ditch full of gasoline that runs right through the soldiers? Really? This movie was frustratingly lame. Im looking forward to it getting the youtube treatment - like Darth Schwartzeneger. Save your money. I think all the pumped up A+ reviews are either trying to get people to make the same mistake they did (misery loves company), or they are so embarassed that they spent money on this turd, that they have to pretend to love it. Just kidding! It was awesome! (See that? For a sec, your heart sped up. You WANT to believe.) Sorry, just kidding about just kidding. It sucked. :: 257 :: Cleo Newell :: 258 :: 16 August 2010 :: 259 :: <STRONG> It at least doesnt disappoint... </STRONG> :: 260 :: First of all... This movie is good. Ive been waiting for this moviefor over a year, and when I heard that it would be delayed, I wasupset. But I saw the movie yesterday in a really small and really hot theater.The cast for this movie was huge, Li, Statham, Lundgren, Rourke,Willis, Schwarzenegger and Stallone himself, WOW! But too bad Willisand Schwarzenegger had so little time on the screen. I like What I really liked about this movie is that there is a lot ofaction scenes that reminds you of the 80s. Just pure action! Theacting was absolutely superb by all stars. The humor that is put intothis movie! I disliked At some scenes in the movie the camera was so close-upthat I had a hard time trying to see what exactly was going on. I did enjoy this movie a lot, but after I stepped out of the theater Iwas still kinda disappointed, maybe I expected too much. Definitely seethis movie on the big screen. You wont regret it! :: 261 :: Matthew Harris :: 262 :: 15 August 2010 :: 263 :: <STRONG> Good Guys until the end </STRONG> :: 264 :: Who would have believe it. An amazing movie with A list tough guys, who can and do sell out theaters, together in one film doing what they do best. Each character added something of themselves to this movie. They story line was believable, the characters real, the emotions of getting older true and straight forward. It is action packed, with all the trimmings-bikes, planes, guns, sweat and pure muscle. No unnecessary sex scenes, a story of connection and hope. A must see for this summer. :: 265 :: Cory Carter :: 266 :: 14 August 2010 :: 267 :: <STRONG> This movie rocks </STRONG> :: 268 :: Was greatly directed and actors where great. i would make u laugh all in the right places. Great movie going to watch it again. :: 269 :: Eugene Burgess :: 270 :: 13 August 2010 :: 271 :: <STRONG> what a PUNCH...... </STRONG> :: 272 :: This movie is by far the best action movie in a LONG time. The cast is absolutley incredible. From the Biggest action stars from the past 15 years all in movie. From Stallone to Courtre to LI to the 2 minute cameos by the terminator and Mr. McClane...story was great too....and ORIGINAL. Thats what I am talking about...this wull make the collection. :: 273 :: Monty Lee :: 274 :: 09 August 2010 :: 275 :: <STRONG> Based on True Tumors </STRONG> :: 276 :: In recent times we have seen many movies with A Great Look, LavishStunts and giving good vibes before the release. And when we see themovie, it seems to be having no soul with only a good body with brandedclothes. Its like a Mannequin, stylishly dressed, standing in theshow-window but having no soul, no life in it. Thats how we should describe Inception. Few months back, same wasthe case with CASH TASHAN. Director Stallone has made films whichare always good in parts and are shot brilliantly, but they lack in thescripting department. The Expendable is another of those movies wherethe bad guys look good, and glorification of the villains are in brightlimelight. The movie was fast paced and will keep you seated throughoutthe GGI gun fires, blood baths and murderous killings. Jet Li Simply the number 1 in Hollywood. Steve Austin One of my favourite actors. Dolph Lundgren No matter what role he does action or romantic it willsuit him. Daniel Craig Good actor but doesnt appears in the film. Eric Roberts Did really well as a bad guy after Star 80. Jason Statham Good to see him in action after so many Crank roles. Charisma Carpenter Soooooooooo beautiful that I dont need to sayanything else about her. Arnold Schwarzenegger His best performance will always be in Aliens. Mickey Rourke Doing really well now keep up the good work. Acting is alright to bad. Eric Roberts plays his part with style,Arnold Schwarzenegger just walks in and out with no much impact, hisrole is stupid Dolph Lundgren too just walks in and dies Bruce Willisoverdoes and gets to the nerves, surprising he got so much praise, heis decent only in his introduction and in the Die-hard inspired sceneRourke looks fake, this guy is a big misfit of Hollywood. What the movie lacks in soul, it makes up with its pace. For those wholiked gangster flicks like Satya and Company, should watch this onesince it will definitely appeal. For the rest who prefer drama, romance and comedy, steer away since thegore might make you lose your appetite. :: 277 :: 	More Movies :: 278 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_373220.jpg :: 279 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 280 :: 	The Tourist (LQ) :: 281 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 282 :: 	Action, Thriller, Drama :: 283 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_372524.jpg :: 284 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 285 :: 	TRON: Legacy (LQ) :: 286 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 287 :: 	Action, Thriller, Adventure :: 288 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_367011.jpg :: 289 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 290 :: 	The Warrior's Way (LQ) :: 291 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 292 :: 	Action, Fantasy, Western :: 293 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_365406.jpg :: 294 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 295 :: 	Faster (LQ) :: 296 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 297 :: 	Action, Crime, Thriller :: 298 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_357188.jpg :: 299 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 300 :: 	Unstoppable :: 301 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 302 :: 	Action, Comedy, Drama :: 303 :: 	Copyright MoviesPlanet.com Â© 2002-2010 All Rights Reserved. :: 304 :: 	Support :: 305 :: 	/support.html :: 306 :: 	| :: 307 :: 	Privacy Policy :: 308 :: 	/privacy-policy.html :: 309 :: 	| :: 310 :: 	Terms of Use :: 311 :: 	/terms-of-use.html :: 312 :: 	| :: 313 :: 	FAQ :: 314 :: 	/faq.html :: 315 :: 	| :: 316 :: 	Help :: 317 :: 	/help.htm :: 318 :: 	Expand :: 319 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-the-expendables-movie-9580.html# :: 320 :: 	next :: 321 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-the-expendables-movie-9580.html# :: 322 :: 	previous :: 323 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-the-expendables-movie-9580.html# :: 324 :: 	Close :: 325 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-the-expendables-movie-9580.html# :: 326 :: 	Previous :: 327 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-the-expendables-movie-9580.html# :: 328 :: 	0/0 :: 329 :: 	Next :: 330 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-the-expendables-movie-9580.html# :: 331 ::

The part I loved the best, though, was the fact that it didnt leave anything out. It didnt keep you guessing as to what wouldve happened after the end of the movie (it tied up every last loose end). The commercials didnt give away the actual movie too much, it was just enough to let you know the main idea of the movie. The acting was amazing and somewhat humorous at the same time. I give this movie infinity thumbs up. I will definitely see this movie 20 more times. More than worth your bucks!...

Only 15-20 minutes into the movie i realized that the action sequencesand the sword battles lack a certain amount of intensity and bloodshed,and the director is more inclined to please the kids than the grown upaudience. Also when one set fight and jump sequences end the movieseems to rush to the next set of fight and jump sequence, with shortdialogues and quirky humor in between. The action sequences themselvesare not very long and although most have been well done, i would havepreferred lesser but more elaborate ones than having too many of them.Due to this the action sequences become a bit of drag towards the endand the climax doesnt feel that strong. The acting of most leadcharacters is amateurish leaving aside Jake and Alfred Molina who fitsthe role of a crook merchant with a lighter side. Gemma Arteton on theother hand stands out as most irritating as princess whatever whocannot act and speaks with a heavy British accent in a movie with anArabic setting. The method of storytelling does not leave any room forcharacter development or growth of story. Dont get me wrong, the storyof PoP is the strongest point of the movie and the only thing that keptme interested. It is the way it has been told that leaves a lot to bedesired, which actually is not a surprise to me as Mike Newell, thedirector was also involved in Harry Potter and the goblet of fire, theweakest movie in the franchise. Though it was refreshing to see a videogame movie possessing a good story because attempts prior to this hadno story to speak of, let alone a bad one. A serious take on the good story and maybe no involvement of Disneywould certainly have helped in making it a more mature movie than whatit is. Still give it 610 just for the story which otherwise is a pop cornentertainer. :: 279 :: Deja Lampley :: 280 :: 05 June 2010 :: 281 :: <STRONG> An Outstanding Movie! </STRONG> :: 282 :: The Prince of Persia was definattly not the movie I thought it was going to be. I thought it would have a lot more magic and fantasy in it. Not all war and things like that. Jake Gyllenhaal portrayed the character of Prince Destan very well and made him stand out. The effects were realistic and the story was interesting, but slightly confusing. I would recommend this movie to people who are looking for a good fight with just a touch of comedy. :: 283 :: Leo Tetrault :: 284 :: 04 June 2010 :: 285 :: <STRONG> In my opinion, first good video game to movie transition </STRONG> :: 286 :: I am a big video game nerd, so when a good game or game series get madeinto a movie or movies, I get excited, and nervous. Turning a videogame into a movie is a hard process, because so much of what makes agood video game good, is the interaction between the storyline and theuser control. Without a movie theater that lets us vote on what we wantto happen or what we want the main character to do, the whole thingloses that decision aspect. So it is hard to make a good video movie. I have seen many other movies based off of video games. The Super MarioBros movie... awful. The Bloodrayne series, and any other movie done byUwe Boll is just terrible (he has turned a lot of video games intomovies), Silent Hill was a decent movie, but compared to the originalgame, it wasnt that respectable. The Resident Evil movies had hardlyanything to do with the original games so I cant even compare them.That is all I can think of off the top of my head. Other GOOD directors such as Peter Jackson, want to try and tackle suchan idea, specifically with Jackson, the Halo games. He and othersinvolved in that project realized it would be too hard, too costly, andtoo problematic to make such a highly rated game series into a movie,so it got put an indefinite hold. So even good directors like PeterJackson take their time with the idea. So going into this movie, I was expecting to be disappointed. The Sandsof Time was one of my favorite games for the gamecubePS2xbox console.When I was done with the movie, I was throughly impressed. It wasntgroundbreaking in cinematography or anything of the sort, but for thetype of movie director Jerry Bruckheimer had to deal with, he did agreat job. The movie itself didnt mirror the actual game, because if so, it wouldhave been a crazy movie, but it did keep the major key elements thatwas in the original story. There was even some homages paid in themovie, that normally wouldnt have been smart film shots, butreferenced to the cinematic in the game. It was small things like thatthat made me appreciate the movie more. The movie had great action,thoughtful dialog and really interesting CG that complemented the keystory concepts I mentioned earlier. The only complaints I had were - There were some cheesy lines fromtime to time, but I was kind of expecting that since it is a Disneymovie. - The fight style of the game, of Dastan, was unique and is oneof the main reason the game was so much fun to play. He was a fast,acrobatic fighting machine. He would jump and flip off walls, slide,turn, dive off anything and everything in the game, making theobstacles an interesting play through. In the movie, they do have somescenes where he has to show those skills, but it is only for a shorttime. He does do a good amount of fighting, but less of the acrobatics.I really wish they did a little more of that in the movie. Besides that, I thought it was a great movie, and anyone else thatlikes a good action movie, or anyone that was a big fan of the gamesshould go see it! :: 287 :: Gloria Clark :: 288 :: 03 June 2010 :: 289 :: <STRONG> Actually Pretty Damn Good, flawed but much better than the critics reviews </STRONG> :: 290 :: This movie was much better than the poor reviews it got, and actuallybetter than I hoped, and Im no softy when it comes to reviewing moviesbut I think both this and Robin Hood got a bad rap by the critics, bothmovies while flawed were still quite enjoyable. I think this movie fellvictim to a bad ad campaign that actually made the movie seem LESSinteresting than it really is. Gemma Arterton shines in this, her mostverbose role to date, and Gylenhaal is actually pretty damn good aswell, though outdone by his co-star, and Alfred Molina puts in a greatperformance as comic relief for the movie. I think the mostridiculous part of the whole movie is the damn British accents (WHY!???). To compare it to Bruckheimers other famous franchise I wouldsay it is faaar better than Pirates 3, slightly better than Pirates2 and not as good as the original Pirates, that should give you agood idea of what to expect. :: 291 :: Katrina Jewett :: 292 :: 02 June 2010 :: 293 :: <STRONG> Great Movie </STRONG> :: 294 :: Great!!!

As if they did not know when to end the movie. Very predictable and very boring. The fight seens were boring and not really all that spectacular. the special effects were ok but i have seen better in 2000. The story was hard to understand and not very clever. Some video games do well on the big screen but his is not one of them. I almost fell asleep a few times.

The game is cited as one of the best titlesavailable on multiple counsels (of its time). The title Prince, themost famous middle easterner in video gaming was first introduced in1989 as a PC oriented take on platforming gameplay made popular bySuper Mario Bros. a few years earlier. The franchise lay dormant forseveral years later after a failed foray into 3D on Sega Dreamcast andwas reintroduced with the Sands of Time trilogy. Im saddened to write another film review discouraging people fromseeing a film based on a video game. This may be the best of the lot,occurring nearly twenty years after the genre was introduced by thefilm adaptation of Super Mario Brothers in 1993. And like many of itscousins, the movie pushes credulity (even for its video game origins)too the point of absurdity. The main attraction of the game was turnedinto a deus ex machina contrivance in an effort to attain blockbusterclichs. The film version of Sands of Time effectively ignores thefirst games placement in a series and throws elements of all threegames together in one lumpy mess. Its been edited (expanded) tonothing more than the Prince saving Persia from his traitorous uncle. Nothing has time to unfold as either moviegoers or fans of the gamewould like. Those who have not played the game will not like how theyare bludgeoned with well-executed but relentless action sequences. Someof these are done in real time without the addition of too many digitaleffects. They are the most memorable parts, and youll know which theyare. Video game players controlled the Prince through a variety ofobstacles as they guided him to an objective. Completing the game didnot require all enemies to be defeated, and it was sometimes favorableto leave them be. The film Prince is as cunning as any video gameplayer but too rash. Our hero was determined and fearless yet shrewd.He would disapprove of his representation here. I did enjoy how the films fights were staged, even the hallucinogenicCGI ones. The platforming element of the game was replicated very well.We see the prince run along walls, jump from place to place, and usehis dagger to reverse the flow of time (see title). Admittedly, thedagger is the worse part of the movie. It grants its holder temporarytime travel, and the screenwriters failed to translate it properly intothe story. There are two narrative purposes to it that are laughablybad. The film ends with the dagger being corrupted and magicallysending the Prince back to the beginning of the movie where heapprehends his uncle and experiences the mandatory happy ending. Thisis the kind of comedic retailing of a story I would expect out of ayoutube or newgrounds parody. I got another chuckle when I read onWikipedia that the film was delayed due to the 2008 writers strike. I was hoping this would finally be the one game-to-film adaptation Icould freely recommend to anyone. Its another failure, and I now thinkthe great game film will be a low budget adaptation of a non-mainstreamgame. I can see a film noir being made of Hotel Dusk Room 315. Filmstudios, I beseech you, buy the movie rights to a recently releasedwell-received game that didnt sell very well. Let someone be forced tocraft a satisfying film out of it and release it in few locations. 30th of 2010 Not Recommended ) :: 319 :: 	More Movies :: 320 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_373220.jpg :: 321 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 322 :: 	The Tourist (LQ) :: 323 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 324 :: 	Action, Thriller, Drama :: 325 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_372524.jpg :: 326 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 327 :: 	TRON: Legacy (LQ) :: 328 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 329 :: 	Action, Thriller, Adventure :: 330 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_367011.jpg :: 331 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 332 :: 	The Warrior's Way (LQ) :: 333 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 334 :: 	Action, Fantasy, Western :: 335 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_365406.jpg :: 336 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 337 :: 	Faster (LQ) :: 338 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 339 :: 	Action, Crime, Thriller :: 340 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_357188.jpg :: 341 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 342 :: 	Unstoppable :: 343 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 344 :: 	Action, Comedy, Drama :: 345 :: 	Copyright MoviesPlanet.com Â© 2002-2010 All Rights Reserved. :: 346 :: 	Support :: 347 :: 	/support.html :: 348 :: 	| :: 349 :: 	Privacy Policy :: 350 :: 	/privacy-policy.html :: 351 :: 	| :: 352 :: 	Terms of Use :: 353 :: 	/terms-of-use.html :: 354 :: 	| :: 355 :: 	FAQ :: 356 :: 	/faq.html :: 357 :: 	| :: 358 :: 	Help :: 359 :: 	/help.htm :: 360 :: 	Expand :: 361 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-movie-7660.html# :: 362 :: 	next :: 363 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-movie-7660.html# :: 364 :: 	previous :: 365 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-movie-7660.html# :: 366 :: 	Close :: 367 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-movie-7660.html# :: 368 :: 	Previous :: 369 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-movie-7660.html# :: 370 :: 	0/0 :: 371 :: 	Next :: 372 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-movie-7660.html# :: 373 ::

And with its opening, the summer blockbuster seasonstarts in earnest. And I was so excited, I took a relatively long tripto see this movie early. And what a way to start off the movie season. The first Iron Man movie, I think, came as a surprise to many moviefans. Yes, as a member of the Avengers, Iron Man is important in theMarvel Comics Universe, but usually takes a back seat to the IncredibleHulk, Captain America, the X-Men, and of course, Spider-Man. But the first Iron Man movie was comic book perfection. Short of theDark Knight and possibly Spider-Man 2, it may have been the bestsuperhero movie ever, depending on who is making the argument. It tooka relatively unknown character in Robert Downey Jr.s portrayal of theself-loathing, narcissistic playboy billionaire Tony Stark, and broughtthe story t the masses. The introduction story was ideal in every way.And Starks progression from a selfish genius to a superhero is unlikemost we see in movies. And taking that all into consideration, it is incredible that Iron Man2 out duels its predecessor.

Ironman is an excellent example of the power of blue ray, an extremely polished film and one that looks absolutely stunning on Blue Ray. As a movie I have found myself rewatching the first hour more than the second. As with any comic book origin story you learn where the hero comes from, what pushes him to risking his life for others, and a little about where he is going. The interesting thing with this film is that it is far stronger in its early stages when we are learning these facets of our hero than it is after the hero has been constructed (literally in this case). It almost feels as though once the premise is all in place the writers were not really sure what to do with him so they fabricated a quick enemy for him to fight. As an origin story though it is very engaging. So after we have discovered the why and the who behind our superhero there needs to be a super villain standing in opposition and this is where I think the movie falters a little. I got a trifle bored in the last quarter of the movie once the villain of the piece has been revealed. I almost wish they had have ended the story after the origin part was over and spent more time in a sequal on setting up a major villain. Here is hoping that ironman 2 gives us a more convincing nemesis. :: 281 :: Antoinette Delong :: 282 :: 27 March 2009 :: 283 :: <STRONG> Entertaining and fantastic visuals! </STRONG> :: 284 :: The BluRay format is very well suited to this entertaining and visually stunning action movie.

A great disc! :: 285 :: Ronda Chappelle :: 286 :: 04 March 2009 :: 287 :: <STRONG> DONT BUY IT, RENT IT! </STRONG> :: 288 :: This IRON TURKEY isnt a flick youre likely to want to view twice. Oh, it may well be a reasoable or even a competent recreation of a Marvel Comic strip Superhero, I dont know because prior to the films publicity I was unfamiliar with the Superhero. But, the publicity campaign was effective and the effort was touted as having been produced with a high level of artistic skill and vision. Nevertheless, five or ten minutes of viewing time, showed the effort to be considerably below the level of other recent films in the CapeActionSuperhero genre. It was patently inferior to HELLBOY, for example, on every level. Or the latest BATMAN. Whats it about? Not much. The first fifteen minutes of the film is so dark and the sound is so confused and muddy, one sits stymied, wondering what comes next. All this takes place somwhere in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area. An American arms manufacturer is captured by terrorists of some sort, who live in caves. (All very well played and costumed, by the way most effective.) They want this man, Tony Stark of Stark Munitions, to make a guided missle for them. Tony has been seriously wounded and now wears a sort of big flashlight diode aray where his sternum ought to be. (Idiotic justification.) Aided by a doomed multi-lingual individual of uncertain origin -- who is somewhat interesting in spite of the far-fetched and murky dialogue -- Stark builds a self-powered, napalm-spurting flying suit of armor, and escapes the cave. He crashes in the desert and is promptly picke up by American copters. Next, he has a one-line epiphany on his way home, which he announces at an impromptu news conference. He intends to lead Stark Enterprises out of the munitions business. Into what, everyone wants to know? I dont know yet, he replies. Now here we have to pay close attention to Jeff Bridges as he proceeds to fold the movie up, stick it in his breast pocket and walk away with it. Hes absolutely terrific the best thing in the movie, by far, playing the role Kris Kristoffersen aced often, and last for Wesley Snipes that of the substitute father-figure. Here hes Big Daddy Warbucks with a shaved head and white beard, sporting good suits and an enormous cigar. A baddie too, for all the difference it makes. But so good and so likeable you yearn to see him from scene to scene until, at the very end, he re-appears driving and wearing a super-flying enhanced armored suit to battle the smaller Tony character in his smaller suit its like the mano-a-mano last scene in ROBOCOP as the good Humanist Robo battles the bad Corporate Robo. Not better, just similar. Second best? Gwenneth Paltrow with a discreetly padded chest, sporting an orange wig and the highest possible stilettoes. She has nothing to work with, character-wise or script-wise, but manages to create the impression that she endures labial seizures every time her co-star comes near to her. Its a feat of acting ability and almost comic, because Downey never does anything that even remotely suggests any degree of physical intimacy. Endlessly condescending, he ignores her and talks over her constantly. Cold and narcissistic, he touches her once when they briefly dance together for a few seconds. Prior to this, she does what Lois Stewart did as Miss Moneypenny in the JAMES BOND Series, rolling her eyes and appearing to ooze as Bond passes by. BACK TO THE PLOT. Whats Tony up to? After his vapid revelation? Hes at work in the billionaireis workshop - garage under his huge billionaires hilltop Malibu cottage, re-fashioning a better version of the iron suit he made whilst among the brigands. Very flashy toys on display. Virtual this and that. Flashy cars. Flashy welding and tooling equipment. Super electronics to handle his secret Power Source. Tedium. Meanwhile, Daddy Warbucks reveals himself as working to take over STARK ENTERPRISES for himself. Purpose? To sell the newest munitions to the insurgents in the hills. Tony finds out and flies -- thats right, flies to Afghanistan -- and Flying ROBOCOP blasts the baddies himself by means of the diodes in his palms and on the soles of his feet. He is attacked by jet planes, but escapes. And then, finally, he meets his nemesis at Stark Labs Headquarters and they fight it out. Well, if you enjoy this genre of action movies -- capes and gadgets and super-powers -- you accept the improbabilites that go along with the fantasies. And, you have your roster of favorite stars, and you might have wondered how it came about that Robert downey Jr got cast in the role? Especially when theres Dwayne The Rock Johnson, Vin Diesel or Wesley Snipes. And thats just the Americans. Unless you figure theyd be an ethnic stretch for the story. But then theres Christian Bale, Patrick Swayze, Orlando Bloom or even Mat Damon and Ben Afflek. And from the set-up, one wonders if IRON MAN might not have been intended for Afflek or Damon? La Paltrow is a personal friend of both men and has appeared with them both in various films. Afflek did well in DAREDEVIL, which did well at the Box Office. Did he tire of the tights and pulleys and wires? Or did Damon commit, and then refuse at the last minute, or after reading the script? Leaving... Gweneth, and crew. Money talks, or in this case, it keeps mum. The project is odd, yet conventional, without being entertaining in an unconventional way. It gave off the feeling of having been stitched together out of whole pieces of comic book and monster movie cliches. Downey doing his red carpet celebrity walk through the crowds while not speaking to anybody directly -- which he did so perfectly in SOAP DISH, one of the best Show-Biz comedies of the 80s -- in imitation of Bruce Wayne many entries and exits in all of the latest BATMAN flicks. But why Downey, particularly? And what about DOWNEY anyway? Well, since his publicized recouperation, it is obvious that the course of treatment involved an intense regimen of body-building, for the actor has managed to become an obvious Gym-Rat, and Gym-Rats have something in common with Downs syndrome people. As Downs sufferers share a round-faced, slant-eyed asian appearance, so Gym-Rats share a gaunt, sunken-cheeked volpine resemblence that makes them look like brothers. Astonishingly, Downey with his pitch black hair, thick browns and inky moustache and goatee, has become the identical twin of venerable Gay porn performer and total Gym Rat, Jason Probe aka Joshua Perez. Well, let me put it to you this way Downey is rather a small, compact man. Everybody in the entire movie is bigger than he is, and some tower over him. This is a very odd handicap for a Superhero. Which makes me wonder why anybody would cast this movie in that way? What is the point? The Mighty Mouse effect. It trivializes everything the hero does. And if Mr. Downeys height wasnt a consideration in the casting of this movie, why would any producer hire the same casting people to do another job? This is a re-hash of the old BULLETMAN strip. But, as I say. Look at it once and return it the next day. Its good for a bag of popcorn. :: 289 :: Harold Reiter :: 290 :: 27 February 2009 :: 291 :: <STRONG> Iron Man </STRONG> :: 292 :: This movie is awesome. Iron Man looks so cool and he has lots of interesting weapons. Im not going to write down the entire story and bore you because someone else probably has already. Robert downey jr. (I think that is his name)plays as Iron Man. He does such a good job and hes really funny. There arent any bad actors in the movie. The Iron Man suit looks so real I just want to pause the movie and look at him. If you want a good movie to watch on a Friday night with some friends, this is the perfect movie. :: 293 :: James Stevens :: 294 :: 15 February 2009 :: 295 :: <STRONG> a very cool superhero movie </STRONG> :: 296 :: Iron Man is a very awesome movie to watch. he built 2 other variations of suits before he built the red and gold one. my impression is that it was a 2000s imitation of Robocop. Hugo Weaving, who was the voice of Megatron, supplied the voice for the bad robot. I heard plenty of rock in this movie, but I didnt hear any cussing. if I had kids, I would be comfortable in letting them watch this movie. :: 297 :: Mario Sherrell :: 298 :: 06 January 2009 :: 299 :: <STRONG> Iron-Man gets it right. Looking forward to more. </STRONG> :: 300 :: Iron-Man doesnt mess it up when it could have been easy to do so and Robert Downey Jr is on top form in a story about him being a multi-billionaire weapons tycoon who finds his products used against Americans and so develops an Iron-Man suit to combat Muslim terrorists that kidnapped him, killed his friend and tried to use his technology in ways that he didnt foresee. Things go from bad to worse when he finds his company has been double-dealing and business partners have turned bad. In short Iron-Man is Robocop for young adults but Downey Jr actually puts on a worthwhile performance that overshadows when he puts on the suit. Even with the suit on the flying through the sky moments are well worth the wait and while the fights and finale are kept on a somewhat small scale they are still good. Overall Iron-Man delivers on an interesting balance of action and content. If you like quality superhero movies then you cant go wrong with this. :: 301 :: Fanny Brown :: 302 :: 23 December 2008 :: 303 :: <STRONG> Coooool superhero movie </STRONG> :: 304 :: great movie, robert downey jr. as tony stark is a great performance and the direction was amazing. if youre a comic fan, it will be a 100 SATISFACTION GUARANTEED. :: 305 :: Marco Scurry :: 306 :: 16 December 2008 :: 307 :: <STRONG> Eccentric Machine Humor </STRONG> :: 308 :: Iron Man entertains exceedingly well thanks to the jovial performance of Robert Downey Jr. While his song Your Move from the 4-year old CD The Futurist is just now in my personal top ten sounding like a new record from Yes, I picked up a copy of Iron Man for my rainy day video shelf. Downey was nominated for an Oscar in 1992 for Chaplin and for a Golden Globe in 2000 for TVs Ally McBeal. As weapons dealer Tony Stark, he moves from the hard-nosed wheeler dealer to a man with a conscience. I understood why Jeff Bridges character Obadiah Stane would want to remove him after he has a conscience, but wasnt altogether clear why he wanted to get rid of Tony when he was a money maker. Perhaps it was jealousy. The great humor that Downey brings to the role, particularly with his eccentric machine that keeps wanting to spray him to put out fires, makes the action all the better. There is also a hint of romance with Pepper Potts played by Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow for 1998s Shakespeare in Love. Terrence Howard has been a favorite actor of mine since Crash (Widescreen Edition) and his Oscar-nominated role in Hustle Flow (Widescreen Edition). Perhaps one of the best parts is played by Shaun Toub who shined in the Oscar winning Crash as the Iranian store clerk. In captivity, Stark meets Toubs Yinsen who becomes his assistant and sacrifices himself for Tony. Faran Tahir as the rebel leader Raza is excellent. John Favreau who is currently acting in Four Christmases directs the film and keeps the pace breakneck. This is a great actionspecial effects picture. Enjoy! :: 309 :: Ralph Griffin :: 310 :: 25 November 2008 :: 311 :: <STRONG> Blows Dark Knight out of the water </STRONG> :: 312 :: Now here is a comic book movie. They didnt mess too much with the costume, it didnt take itself waaaay too serious and it stayed fairly faithful to the source material. Plus we got that real cool set up for the Avengers. When I saw the movie in the theatre all the fanboys went nuts for that little bit at the end of the credits, and I was impressed too. I wish I had thought of it. Downey Jr. is great as Stark (unlike Christian Bale with that silly diguised voice.) It shows that you can stay pretty faithful to the source material and still make a good film. It pleased the fans AND the general audience, AND it really was Iron man. Not a guy in an armored batsuit who usually has the intellect of Sherlock Holmes but (in this movie version) gets others to do his thinking for him. Oh right.... that was another summer film. Iron man was the film of the summer as far as I am concerned. :: 313 :: Clint Nord :: 314 :: 30 October 2008 :: 315 :: <STRONG> Ironman </STRONG> :: 316 :: This movie was great in the theater and just as good on blu ray. It is nice that they are turning classic comic series into feature films. :: 317 :: Jonathan Freeman :: 318 :: 27 October 2008 :: 319 :: <STRONG> Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark </STRONG> :: 320 :: WARNING SPOILERS WARNING On the surface the script for Iron Man is simple and basic. We find out the origin of Iron Man, how he builds the suit and a major villain arrives with a similar suit to challenge him. Iron Man saves the day etc. rinse repeat. What makes this comic book movie great and one of the best adaptations of all time is 1 thing. Robert Downey Jr. I had been a comic book fan since I was a kid, and while I mainly collected Spider-Man, I knew Iron Man and his back story. I knew him but never really was into him except when the story revolved around Tony Stark and his personal life. While usually the book is better than the movie, this is one of those rare exceptions where the real life version far exceeds the book. Quite simply, like Heath Ledger as The Joker, you dont see Downey Jr. on the screen but Tony Stark. Yes, hes that good. Whoever casted Downey for this movie deserves a raise or of the profits because without him the movie doesnt excel. Yes the CGI is fantastic but the other people cast in the movie dont inspire the audience. Paltrow is fine, Howard I thought was good (bad move replacing a decent character who wanted to return for the sequel with Don Cheadle as good as he is), Bridges is very good but this movie belongs to Downey Jr. Sometimes a basic script can be made exceptional when you find a definitive actor to play a role. Not only will this film make comic book fans happy, it is perfect for both genders, all ages, or anyone that likes movies in general. One of the greatest comic book movies of all time and a joy to watch that instantly ranks in the top 5 of said adaptations ever made. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION :: 321 :: Mable Payne :: 322 :: 07 October 2008 :: 323 :: <STRONG> Entertaining! </STRONG> :: 324 :: Good action superhero movie, very slick and very hollywood. Decent overall but no particular stand-out points here. :: 325 :: Eugene Dwyer :: 326 :: 04 October 2008 :: 327 :: <STRONG> after the ending </STRONG> :: 328 :: after the final scene when they have a press conference and ask Who Is Ironman? it quickly goes to the credits (lots of info) but you can skip to the end of it(after the dolby logo) there is a 30 second scene that will suprise you for the next movie, someone who will amaze you that they will be there. :: 329 :: John Gagne :: 330 :: 26 September 2008 :: 331 :: <STRONG> Downey is legendary in this role </STRONG> :: 332 :: Im biased. I loved the film, and saw it twice at the theatre. Downey was a surprise casting decision for me, but it works perfectly. He brings an attitude and maturity that a younger man would not have had. The film succeeds better than most comic book adaptations by not trying too hard to be cool. There is a realism in the narrative that is subtle, but effective. Luckily, even though its an FX driven film, its not edited in a way that draws your attention to them. That being said, the FX are INCREDIBLE. The final fight is fairly anti-climactic. BUT its AWESOME from start to finish. Great funny gratuitous action. :: 333 :: Beatrice Noble :: 334 :: 13 August 2008 :: 335 :: <STRONG> If you only buy one Blu Ray this summer, this is it </STRONG> :: 336 :: Im a fan of Marvel comics, have been since I was a kid. After X-MEN, Fantastic 4, Spider Man and the Hulk flicks, I thought Iron man might be scraping the bottom of the barrel. Boy, was I wrong. I think its one of the best, out of all the comic-book-to-big-screen releases. Dark Knight has no equal, its probably not fair to throw that in the mix. We all know whos Number One. But this movie was great!!!! This is absolutely on my short list of movies I can watch over and over, and I cant wait to do that on my PS3, surround sound and really, really big TV! :: 337 :: Adam Bush :: 338 :: 12 June 2008 :: 339 :: <STRONG> Iron Man--Works...And Then Some </STRONG> :: 340 :: Many of the Marvel Films projects--outside of the Spider-Man (thus far) trilogy--have met with some very mixed results and reviews. One is left wondering if Marvel has rushed their Universe out there too quickly. Certainly, Iron Man--given to Jon Favreau to direct, and the controversial decision to go with Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark--left many pondering if the right decisions were made in production and casting. Well...THAT WAS SETTLED. What we found out was that RDJ was not just a good pick, but a GREAT pick to play the hard-partying, hard-drinking weapons manufacturer who, when captured by terrorists who want him to make a weapon, comes up with a Ned Kelly-like suit of iron (The suit us fanboys recognize as the original Iron Man suit), and proceeds to get medieval on the terrorist encampment. There were many who thought that Oded Fehr (Of The Mummy and Resident Evil movies) was the more likely choice to be Stark, but RDJ--and his own personal history with alcohol and drugs cant be dismissed in this casting--is nothing short of brilliant. At points, RDJ does his usual fast-paced one liners and makes them part of Stark, but there are points that--with the epiphany his character has about 40 minutes in--that Downey becomes the performer we saw in Chaplin. The casting is incredibly solid--Gwynneth Paltrows return to work as Pepper Potts, Jeff Bridges take on Obidiah Stane, and Terrence Howards military liason to Stark, James Rhodes...plus, we can all see the sequel (or sequels) being set up through the movie--Howards looking at the second suit and saying someday... prepares us for War Machine, and the terrorist organization that captures Stark--the Ten Rings--is an obvious reference to The Mandarin... But this movie ultimately is made...because Jon Favreau knew more than the bloggers when it came to casting Tony Stark. He went with Robert Downey Jr, and because of that, Iron Man works... AND THEN SOME. :: 341 :: Rita Sparks :: 342 :: 21 May 2008 :: 343 :: <STRONG> An entertainining movie, especially for the pulsating action sequences witty dialogue! </STRONG> :: 344 :: Frankly, I could never imagine Robert Downey Jr., playing a superhero. This probably had to do with the initial impression I had from what I had read so much about him - faltering years as a drug addict jail bird in real life. I last saw him as the conniving Dr Kovak in The Shaggy Dog, also as the rogue special agent, John Royce, opposite the characters of Tommy Lee Jones Wesney Snipes in the thriller action movie, US Marshalls, on cable television. With the last movie, The Forbidden Kingdom, in the same movie theatre, my gym buddy I saw a brief trailer of Iron Man, which had sort of piqued our personal interest. Yesterday, my gym buddy decided to go for a movie in the late afternoon, we chose Iron Man at Jurong Point. In a nut shell, Iron Man was more of a CGI-boosted special effects extravaganza. I read from the papers that the movie costed US165 million to make. The movie was based on a superhero character from Marvel Comics, creators of Spiderman, Fantastic Four X-men. Story-wise, it had a relatively simple plot. Robert Downey Jr., played Tony Stark, a billionaire industrialist also an inventor extraordinaire in designing building high tech weaponry of mass destruction for the US Army. His company was known as Stark Industries, founded by his late father, Howard Stark, who was involved with the Manhattan Project. While traveling in Afghanistan on a business trip, his convoy was ambushed in a war zone - he was injured, ironically by a shrapnel from one of his own rockets - was kidnapped by a group of militants, headed by a lunatic who wanted to control the entire Middle East. Kept alive by a make-shift electro-magnet embedded above his heart, apparently designed to prevent the shrapnel from puncturing his heart, Tony was forced by his captors to build a missile with metal scraps electronic leftovers in a cave-enclosed prison. Instead our hero, with his usual cool arrogance drawing on his inventive genius, hatched an escape plan revolving around a crude metallic armoured suit -the advent of the prototype, Iron Man. Of course, he managed to escape - with the electro-magnet over his heart intact - eventually returned to America, seemingly a changed man after seeing the death destruction caused by his companys weapons. With that, he decided arbitrarily that Stark Industries would stop producing military weapons, much to the chagrin of his mentor associate, Obadiah Stane (played by Jeff Bridges), who somehow had other sneaky ideas of his own. Meanwhile, Tony began experimenting with the electro-magnet imbedded over his heart exchanging it with a miniaturised Arc Reactor - apparently a power-yielding generator that could emit enough juice to keep his heart shrapnel-free, at the same time, could provide adequate power to a new armoured suit he had in mind. So, while our hero was cranking his new armoured suit, Stane was secretly conniving with the militants in Afghanistan, who apparently had managed to salvage the original work plans of the armoured suit built in the cave during Tonys captivity. It was during this movie segment that I realised that Tonys unfortunate ambush in Afghanistan was all the while being set up by Stane in a futile attempt to take over Stack Industries. With the original work plans secured from Afghanistan, Stane managed to assemble a team of specialists to build a modified version of the metallic armoured suit, nicknamed Iron Monger. The remaining segment of the movie - in fact, for all the excitement we were waiting for - displayed the power struggle between Tony Stane, eventually culminating into a violent clash - with CGI special effects, of course - between the two heavy metal behemoths, Iron Man Iron Monger. We must accord our thanks to the ingenuity inventiveness of the team from Stan Wilson Studios. If you have the opportunity to watch the sci-fi action movie, Transformers, you would quickly get a good idea of the resultant rampant havoc, when two heavy metal behemoths danced, while humans vehicles got caught beneath their fancy footwork. When compared with Spiderman, Fantastic Four X-men, I had this notion that Iron Man was more like a slapstick comedy to me. The two actresses, one playing Tonys Girl Friday (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) the perky television reporter, were primarily eye candies. I reckon they were there just to show Tonys flamboyance. In fact, the most fascinating gadget in the movie, to me at least, was the flash-drive-sized sonic paralysis emitter, which Stane used to harmlessly knock out his opponents. I would love to have one of that. Did I enjoy watching the movie at the end? I sure did. Was it entertaining? Yes, especially the action sequences witty dialogue. Was it worth spending the two hours in the movie theatre? Yes. My gym buddy felt likewise. At least, I now have a different impression about Robert Downey Jr. :: 345 :: Anthony Martinez :: 346 :: 08 May 2008 :: 347 :: <STRONG> Exceptional !!! (No Spoilers) </STRONG> :: 348 :: This movie is awesome!! Do yourself a favor and go see it in theaters! First thing, after the movie is over, there is a secret final scene. It is after all the credits. (you wont be disappointed) Robert Downey Jr was great as Tony Stark Iron Man. The movie had a wonderful cast including Terence Howard ... Jim Rhodes Jeff Bridges ... Obadiah Stane Gwyneth Paltrow ... Pepper Potts Leslie Bibb ... Christine Everhart Jon Favreau directed this movie and plays a small role and Iron Man creator Stan Lee even has a cameo in the movie. Personally I thought Gwyneth Paltrow was great in her role. The movie itself has a great story, great back story and outstanding ending.

This is a riotous, hyper-violent movie where the bad guys dont just lose, they get their butts kicked. The characters are lame but then again that is the point. The downside is that the characters are two-dimensional and almost lame they are so pure and righteous. The acting is dreadful and the script is just so lame that the good story telling is dragged down by the need to drop an F-Bomb every other word. I mean that this script seems to be written by 14 year old boys who think it is cool to swear. While that drags down the script, the performances do rescue it. All in all this is a fun movie. Watch it, but like I said, turn your brain off to enjoy! :: 258 :: Jose Martin :: 259 :: 11 May 2010 :: 260 :: <STRONG> Visceral, violent and could be alarmingly disturbing, but still what fun! </STRONG> :: 261 :: Uma Thurmans The Bride would certainly show Kick Ass to her daughter, in time to prepare both themselves for Tarantinos Volume Three. Kick Ass is a bloody, violent action extravaganza that is smart enough to find its own footing, without being bogged down by censorship, and audience expectations. The highlight of the film is Hit Girl, who singlehandedly steals the spotlight from all her adult counterparts, including Kick Ass himself. This element of deconstruction, about how an 11-year-old girl could kill, maim, often bloody, with abandonment, and even with relish, is effective, for the most part. However, one of the main reasons why the film did not sit well with other people is in regards to the ethical implications of the character of Hit Girl, whom all fantasies, both carnal and violent, Im sure, have been projected onto her on the big screen. However, though the deconstruction of the representation of superheroes and also our myriad of expectations coming from the typical way they are drawn is merely effective for the most part in this film, the lack of dramatic and emotional substantiality is what weakens the film, in regards to where it stands on ethics and morality. It does not matter if there is a lack of ethics and morality in the film, it is after all, a deconstruction, a satire, an overturning of the comic book and super hero genre. However, it seems to gloss it over at the end. Yes, this is a film about superheroes, but it does not mean that it could just skim over the emotional and dramatic nature even flawed superheroes are just as humans as the viewers who root for them. Hit Girl appears to be merely shaken, not traumatized by the end. Sure, she has been efficiently trained to be like that however, she is still a child. Even Batman in The Dark Knight had been given a chance to contemplate, Hit Girl has only been given a scene with her staring down at melted marshmallows floating in hot chocolate getting cold, a scene that does humanize her, but not enough. Having said that, Kick Ass is a great film, but it can only be truly appreciated by those who are able to understand it enough within a contextual postmodern realm, others will shrug it off as immoral and pointless. :: 262 :: Alice Buckley :: 263 :: 24 April 2010 :: 264 :: <STRONG> Obscene and depraved </STRONG> :: 265 :: Hit Girl was the best part of this movie. I love watching little girls swear. I love watching little girls kill. I love watching men beat up little girls. And most of all, I love watching little girls holding big guns. It makes me feel like such a Big Daddy. Whats wrong with all of you people who love this movie? :: 266 :: Michael White :: 267 :: 22 April 2010 :: 268 :: <STRONG> Over-hyped mixture of everything </STRONG> :: 269 :: Let me start by saying Do not believe the hype! It is not a bad movie,but definitely not an 8.5 movie and I hope I can explain my concerns. First This movie has not a consistent way of storytelling. You haveparts that look like a teenage comedy and two minutes later the musicchanges and the look of the movie changes and suddenly you have a darkand heavy atmosphere. This change did not look artistic to me. Itrather looked, like someone messed up different genres because he hadno idea what this movie should look like. Teenagers are not allowed inthis film and most adults will be bored by the teenage life of the leadactor. It is neither fish nor meat, it is inconsistent. Second To me the development of the characters was messed up too. Ittook 35 minutes to describe kick ass (although you knew after 5 minuteswhat this character is supposed to be), but it took only two minutes todescribe hitgirl. Third The soundtrack is a reason why this movie is so messed up. Insome scenes you had a real film score (when big daddy killed the peoplein the warehouse), that created an intense atmosphere, in other scenesyou had some party music that was just inappropriate. Hitgirl justlost her father and two minutes later we have partytime again? To methe soundtrack did not help to make it a good movie. Fourth I love violent movies. I loved 300, I loved inglorious basterdsand so on. I am not a wuss. A well done killing of evil gangsters isalways welcome. But in this movie the violence did not help the movieto become something solid. Why putting the guy in the microwave? Forwhat reason? Just to see him explode? Why killing the guy in the carcompactor? Just for seeing him explode too? The big problem is againthe inconsistence of the entire movie. If it would have been just acomedy, than fine. Would it have been just a dark movie like Darkknight, than fine. But this strange clutter of genres destroys it andleaves the viewer helpless. Should I laugh, because the other peopleare laughing, although the scene is not funny? Should I feel somethingdeep when big daddy dies? In some moments I thought, that I feltemotionaly raped in some strange way. Someone forces me to laughabout something that is just not appropriate to laugh about. I could write much more (script, acting, cut...), but the result isThis movie does not know what it should be. The movie was OK, but mylife would be a little bit better without having seen it. :: 270 :: Kim Grove :: 271 :: 21 April 2010 :: 272 :: <STRONG> WATCH KICK-ASS!!!!! </STRONG> :: 273 :: We went and see what all the fuss was about and we loved KICK-ASS. Second best to Avatar. Cant wait until the sequel. Go and watch KICK-ASS and you will see what we are talking about. Final thought GO AND WATCH KICK-ASS!!!!!! :: 274 :: Natalie Blackburn :: 275 :: 20 April 2010 :: 276 :: <STRONG> Best Movie Since The Dark Knight </STRONG> :: 277 :: At first I did not expect too much from Kick-Ass, and thought it would be like Fantastic Four. Boy was I wrong, I thought Iron Man 2 had best super hero of the year movie on lock, but now I dont know. I am a huge Iron Man fan, but it is going to take a-lot to beat this. Overall great blend of super hero stuff, comedy, and action. :: 278 :: Tonya Gray :: 279 :: 19 April 2010 :: 280 :: <STRONG> Grate and enjoyable </STRONG> :: 281 :: In a movie industry cluttered with own-grown hype, gimmicks and lack ofidea, Kick Ass bursts onto the screen and shatters all expectationsin its wake. Youre on this page because you think its gonna be good?Wrong. Or youre here because you think it looks a decent or a goodsuperhero movie to join the ranks of the ones you already love? DEADwrong. Reason being, is Kick Assdozent want to be good or aboveaverage, Kick Ass wants to be great and it has the balls to want tobe original too. Seemingly impossible in a done to death genre whereweve already glimpsed Mark Millars signature style in Wanted, butKick Ass is all about the unexpected. Make no mistake, nothing you believe of this movie compares to whatVaughn and co. serve up for you. Mainly because everyone involved seemsdetermined to Honor the comic and redefine a genre. Most moviesentertain, but this one? It wants to BLOW YOU AWAY! Less smarter movieshave done that but Kick Ass aint giving that up either. Its scriptis razor-sharp, dumping the pretension of the burden of heroismcrippling even the better superhero films, showing this in actionsrather than long drawn out emoting. Matthew Vaughn has finally solvedthe hurdle that all superhero movies suffer, namely how to get to knowand love your characters without long drawn out scenes. He does it bykeeping them moving. The more they do, the more they try, the more youknow and love them. And make the narrative interesting and most of allratable so were with Dave 100 of the way, it dozent just have tofunctional. The real visual joy of Kick Ass is its desire to keep it simple butnot at the expense of wowing us. Make characters do cool things,instead of Michael Bay-esquire things happening to them. Thats whythey exude coolness, despite Daves almost humdrum existence. This isthe everyman doing the things we could do if wanted to not a guy fromanother reality or possessed with great drive and ambition. Dave wantsto get laid. He wants to be hip. Even your bad guy in this isbelievable. Watching the whirlwind that is Hit Girl perform a routinealmost straight out of Jackie Chans Hong Kong days stuns us in a wayno big screen chase ever could. Visually the film takes all the thingwe DID love from the movies that ultimately didnt zing and churns theminto a finely balanced flawless brew. Did I mention its feel good? From its inspired use of music (againutterly ratable) right down to its outstanding score, like GetCarter for superheroes I could say more but theres surprises instore. In a movie this stunning, acting is usually secondary (as any JamesCameron film shows). Not a bit of it. In a cast as eclectic as thestyles the film embraces you have performances that set a benchmark forall concerned. Can Mark Strong already better his stellar work? See hismenacing and humorous turn as DAmico, a career best. Christopher MintzPlasse follows Role Models by breaking out of McLovin mode. His guyhas layers and he can show them. Nicolas Cage as expected returns tohis past glories playing larger than life eccentric characters but notwithout a little sadness too. Joining him is Chloe Moretz foreverdestined to be remembered for her first major role. She idolizedAngelina Jolie apparently. Guess what, you trounced any action movieshe has ever made! Moretz dominates any scenes shes in, no easy taskconsidering her fellow cast! Aaron Johnson has the most difficult jobof all. Being an original umber-geek after Michael Cera set thestandard (anyone whos seen Zombieland knows its hard to write anoriginal geek even in a great movie). He shakes it, redefines it andOWNS it. He leads the movie like he wrote it, joined by a cast whereeven the smallest roles are fully fleshed out. Its quite an ensemble.A renegade band of acting styles forming a perfect one andcomplementing the films fun style. Watching Kick Ass is ultimately like being on a thrill-ride, itdozent just want to dazzle you, its wants to draw you in, ride thewave and leave the cinema on a high. And it dozent do that withgimmicks or tried and tested formulas, it breaks the mold, shakesconventions and wants you to be surprised while complementing all themovies you already love. Its not just a movie, its a standard, onethat promises to prove movies like this can be written with great heartand brain. :: 282 :: Larry Fricke :: 283 :: 17 April 2010 :: 284 :: <STRONG> Amazing </STRONG> :: 285 :: I had my doubts about Kick-Ass after seeing the trailers. It seemedlike just another typical teenagersex comedy. Yes, the movie doescontain humor that could fit in to that category, but this movie wasmore than that. Kick-Ass starts with a very comedic tone and suddenlyfades in to an in-your-face action film which..kicks ass. First off,this movie is NOT a child-friendly film. It contains extremely graphicviolence mostly involving the 11 year old, Hit-Girl. The storyline ofthis movie grabs you from the beginning. It follows a story of revengeinvolving Big Daddy and Hit-Girl. This movie is very funny but overall,a solid action film. This kills are crazy, the tone is just sohardcore, and the laughs keep coming throughout the whole film. Thismovie is a must-see for anyone who enjoys action, comedy, and drama.Overall fantastic movie. :: 286 :: Beulah Beall :: 287 :: 16 April 2010 :: 288 :: <STRONG> Non-stop Flippin awesome movie!!!!!! </STRONG> :: 289 :: This movie was incredibly awesome from start to finish. I would recommend this to every single friend I have. The critics who dissed this movie are definitely out of touch with quality entertainment. :: 290 :: Abby Sinha :: 291 :: 07 April 2010 :: 292 :: <STRONG> Does exactly what it says on the ticket! </STRONG> :: 293 :: This film is quite literally Kick-Ass. One of the few fresh feelingcomedies around nowadays. The story is believable, the casting issuperb and action scenes dont feel rushed and flow along with thefilm. For anyone who was expecting to see a slightly humorousself-indulgent comic flick this will blow you away. Ill be honest inthat some elements of the story seemed like cheats, especially theending shot. But these short-cuts are totally acceptable for thebrilliant moments of genius comedy that flood the movie. Id also liketo say that Nic Cage is tremendous as Big daddy, showing his truediversity as an actor once again. To sum up this film.....Im sorry tosay it again....KICKS ASS! :: 294 :: William Stewart :: 295 :: 02 April 2010 :: 296 :: <STRONG> I must have seen a different movie than everyone else here ... </STRONG> :: 297 :: Not having read the graphic novel upon which its based, I had noexpectations waking into Kick-Ass. The basic concept of a young mandressing up to act like a superhero wasnt that far out there, butoutside of it would be so super cool if there was nothing in the filmthat spoke to why this kid wanted was willing to get himself killed ina stupid outfit. I love super hero movies (the Dark Knight being myfavorite movie in years) and yet I dont know how many I found myselfsaying this is too stupid to believe throughout the film. In otherwords, the writing was weak, at times so weak that I found myselfcringing at the hackneyed, shallow and two dimensional dialogue, andmystified by the inconsistent behavior of the characters (eg. Red Mistcold bloodedly kills Hit Girl, and then is sooooo upset that Kick-Assis being abused ... just plain stupid). While the actions sequenceswere well choreographed and the acting of Nick Cage and Chloe Moretzkept it interesting, the mind numbing predictability of the storytelling was simply fatal. If youre 12, love comics and have no needfor a compelling coherent story in your films, by all means seeKick-Ass. In not, stay away. :: 298 :: Wilma Keyes :: 299 :: 31 March 2010 :: 300 :: <STRONG> Kick Ass does exactly what it says on the label. Oh yeah. </STRONG> :: 301 :: Now being a fan of Matthew Vaughns last two films, Kick-Ass clearlyseemed like his most controversial outing to date, without evencomparing it to his other work. Both Layer Cake and Stardust boththough enjoyable and well received felt like discrete nods to thedistributors that this man can do a fine job of directing no matterwhat the genre and that he deserves the room for development, sinceshowing he is capable of great potential. Then came along Kick-Ass, which easily is one of this years must sees,simply because it is nothing and everything like you expect. ExampleExpect the costumes to look out of place, expect the C-word bomb froman 11 year old girl and expect a finale that almost makes the end ofKill Bill Volume 1 look like a fairytale. However what wasnt expectedwas the hilarious conversations between Big Daddy (Nic Cage as aEarless Batman) and his daughter Hit Girl (The awe inspiring ChloeMoretz) and the vast amount of violence, dark humour and the way itwalks all over society like another blood splattered corpse ofsatisfaction. Dave Livewski (Aaron Johnson) struggles to understand why there is noactive costumed vigilantes around in New York to stop crime, andthrough his comic inspired heroism decides to become Kick-Ass (The herothis time, not the film title). So with his cheesy green wetsuit,determination and lack of social life, Daves roller-coaster begins.His near fatal experiences doesnt hinder his growing reputation orsuperhero buddies including Red Mist (Superbads ChristopherMintz-Plasse) and the infamous father-daughter duo to bringingblood-blitzed peace to a crime-ridden city. Kick-Ass is a guilty pleasure that people shouldnt be ashamed to enjoyon the basis of the blaspheming and gore infested mass killings. Thereis a huge amount of likability for the leads who have all done justiceto make the most of their characters capabilities Chloe Moretzdeserves particular credit to her notorious role by putting the Gonnablow your brains out in well, just that. Matthew Vaughn has clearlyestablished himself as a man of many talents and after this its nothard to see why, there is certainly room for a sequel on the horizon,thats for sure. :: 302 :: Alfredo Wilde :: 303 :: 19 March 2010 :: 304 :: <STRONG> Screw Peter Parker. </STRONG> :: 305 :: I was lucky enough to get tickets to a free London preview last night(thank you Empire). I was little concerned because I saw the LAST VaughanGoldmancollaboration Stardust, which managed to remove all of the horror andmost of the magic from Neil Gaimans and Charles Vess magicalfairy-tale and turn it into an anodyne, emasculated chase-movie. Forget that. They have redeemed themselves in mine eye (although theymay still be off Neil Gaimans Christmas card list for a while yet). I need to tell you (just like the nice man asked at the beginning ofthis movie), GO AND SEE THE Film. Its a funny, very knowing and self-aware play on the mythos ofsuperhero movies that takes itself JUST seriously enough in the actionscenes whilst at the same time making them so OTT that Shoot em Uplooks like a Dogme film. Mintz-Plasse has kicked off his McLovin boots in a role that looksvery promising for a sequel, and at LAST Nic Cage is playing a rolethat doesnt require him to boost the share price of Grecian 2000 (Nic.What the HELL were you doing in Ghost Rider? Why, man? WHY?) And AaronJohnson is the everykid that we were between the ages of 10 and 17.Nerdy. Unnoticed. Not even outstanding amongst his non-outstandingfriends. All he wants is to stop the small-time thugs from stealing hisphone please. He has no skill, no training, and no clue. But what hedoes have is an overwhelming belief that he CAN make a difference, inthe face of all reality. Indeed, its this that carries him through.Powered by his own unshakeable certainty, the small time crooks hebattles are beaten mainly by his absolute refusal to lie down when theyhit him. But its Chloe Moretz who is the real stand-out here. Shes going to beremembered for this, her first major role, for a long time. As theinsanely violent Hit-Girl, she treads a delicate line between sweetinnocence and foul-mouthed brutality that promises a great career aheadof her. A totally convincing performance that makes it completelyunderstandable for a 13 year old to get all gushy because shes got anew matching pair of butterfly knives for her birthday. By the time the film reached its climax I was laughing, cheering andclapping like a fanboy at his first Star Trek convention. Like I said. GO AND SEE THIS FILM! Hypnotoad Commands It!! but hell always be McLovin to me. :: 306 :: 	More Movies :: 307 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_373220.jpg :: 308 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 309 :: 	The Tourist (LQ) :: 310 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 311 :: 	Action, Thriller, Drama :: 312 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_372524.jpg :: 313 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 314 :: 	TRON: Legacy (LQ) :: 315 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 316 :: 	Action, Thriller, Adventure :: 317 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_367011.jpg :: 318 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 319 :: 	The Warrior's Way (LQ) :: 320 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 321 :: 	Action, Fantasy, Western :: 322 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_365406.jpg :: 323 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 324 :: 	Faster (LQ) :: 325 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 326 :: 	Action, Crime, Thriller :: 327 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_357188.jpg :: 328 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 329 :: 	Unstoppable :: 330 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 331 :: 	Action, Comedy, Drama :: 332 :: 	Copyright MoviesPlanet.com Â© 2002-2010 All Rights Reserved. :: 333 :: 	Support :: 334 :: 	/support.html :: 335 :: 	| :: 336 :: 	Privacy Policy :: 337 :: 	/privacy-policy.html :: 338 :: 	| :: 339 :: 	Terms of Use :: 340 :: 	/terms-of-use.html :: 341 :: 	| :: 342 :: 	FAQ :: 343 :: 	/faq.html :: 344 :: 	| :: 345 :: 	Help :: 346 :: 	/help.htm :: 347 :: 	Expand :: 348 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-kickass-movie-6888.html# :: 349 :: 	next :: 350 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-kickass-movie-6888.html# :: 351 :: 	previous :: 352 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-kickass-movie-6888.html# :: 353 :: 	Close :: 354 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-kickass-movie-6888.html# :: 355 :: 	Previous :: 356 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-kickass-movie-6888.html# :: 357 :: 	0/0 :: 358 :: 	Next :: 359 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-kickass-movie-6888.html# :: 360 ::

Dre immediately falls for his classmate Mei Ying - and the feeling is mutual - but cultural differences make such a friendship impossible. Even worse, Dres feelings make an enemy of the class bully, Cheng. In the land of kung fu, Dre knows only a little karate, and Cheng puts the karate kid on the floor with ease. With no friends in a strange land, Dre has nowhere to turn but maintenance man Mr. Han, who is secretly a master of kung fu. As Han teaches Dre that kung fu is not about punches and parries, but maturity and calm, Dre realizes that facing down the bullies will be the fight of his life. :: 214 :: 	Movie Photo :: 215 :: 	1-25	Garrett Harper :: 256 :: 11 September 2010 :: 257 :: <STRONG> Only if you dont watch the org. </STRONG> :: 258 :: This might be O.K. if I had not seen the org.,but I did and its not good.It is however more of the P.C. crap Hollywood pushes for you to spend your money on. :: 259 :: Dora Bowen :: 260 :: 10 July 2010 :: 261 :: <STRONG> The Karate Kid is A Winner! </STRONG> :: 262 :: The Karate Kid was a very good movie, and in my opinion better than the original classic. The movie was funny at moments and emotional in others, it made me laugh, cry, and cheer. Also the unique thing about it was it was not a copy cat from the original it had its own storyline, and its own different characters, and frankly Im very proud of the film. Its a feel good, family fun movie, and one for the generation.!! :: 263 :: Corey Hamm :: 264 :: 07 July 2010 :: 265 :: <STRONG> Enjoyable Take On The Karate Kid </STRONG> :: 266 :: The Karate Kid stars Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan as the beloved Masterand apprentice who train for a martial arts contest where he mustdefeat his bully and put an end to the embarrassment he has put himthrough. I thought it was enjoyable, sure the plot was bad, but Still, I feltthe chemistry between Chan and Smith. The mom is annoying, it canconnect to many children. So Overall many children will enjoy it, some adults whove seen theoriginal might not be so happy but hey, its the 20s, get to the newages. :: 267 :: Luz Lovell :: 268 :: 06 July 2010 :: 269 :: <STRONG> Initially Slow but Worth Watching </STRONG> :: 270 :: Movie was excellent - even if there were 4 previous Karate Kid movies. Jaden may become a formidable action star. He is likable and believable in this movie. The training scenes and actual contest scenes are totally believable. You see Will and Jada in his face. :: 271 :: Dorothy White :: 272 :: 30 June 2010 :: 273 :: <STRONG> An awful warning </STRONG> :: 274 :: I have seen a great many bad movies in my life if any of them wereworse than this, I must have repressed the memory. If I could give thisfilm less than a 1, I would. No one seeing a title like The Karate Kid would expect Tarkovsky.However, you might expect something humorously awful that would be goodto watch for laughs over a few beers. Unfortunately, this one passesthrough the So bad its good zone without even slowing down, and endsup firmly in the realm of So bad its depressing. As far as I can tell, someone basically took a ninth-rate kungfu movie(probably Ninja The Final Duel) and welded on a few scenes - perhapsten minutes in total - featuring Jackie Chan. Mr Chan does not actuallydo any kungfu. He simply ambles on in a dashiki and shades from time totime, cocks his head quizzically and says Shee-it a few times. Helooks gray (literally the color is bad throughout, but appears to beparticularly off during his scenes) and depressed. As well he mightbe. The plot is the usual kungfu mishmash of evil ninjas, virtuous monks,and random ass- kickers who periodically meet up and pound on eachother until someone spits blood and collapses. Among the large cast ofpeople who you wont care about there is a pint sized prince, severalmonks with runny makeup, a cackling arch-villain in what looks like aclean- room bunny suit, a character in a Detroit cap and a Ping PongMan. The original English dialog has been - poorly - dubbed in. Somethingmight have been salvaged from the whole train-wreck if the dialog wereactually amusing, but it isnt. The contribution of the writers seemsto have been to throw in a few lame jokes about African-Americanculture, none of which are even slightly funny. The most disturbingthing about the film might actually be that someone - possibly morethan one person - actually believed that this drivel was witty. Theres no reason for this film to exist, except as an awful warning.There is absolutely no reason for anyone to watch it, ever. Its notcheesy or so bad its good. Its just boring and painful. You willnot miss anything if you dont watch it. :: 275 :: Edward Gonzalez :: 276 :: 29 June 2010 :: 277 :: <STRONG> Another One of Those HollyWood BULL Movies </STRONG> :: 278 :: This is just your typical bull movie where the main character is always going to be some kind of caucasian, or in this case black, and he ends up going to some foreign country, usually somewhere in Asia, and trains for a couple months and becomes a master of whatever material arts or skill that that foreign country is known for. He then is able to use that skill to conquer and defeat everyone in that country, when the natives have been training in the art of martial arts their entire lives. COMPLETE BULL! So this kid just walks into China knowing no martial arts at all and trains for a couple months and suddenly becomes the God of Chinese martials and defeats all those who have been training their whole lives. This is just the same en theme over and over again. Hollywood is just trying to show how the the Western Countries are always going to be dominant in everything because their people are all prodigies and that they only require a couple months to master something that others require a lifetime to do. These Hollywood movies are so full of that its en disgusting. And the sad thing about this is that people eat this up. This is just like the Last Samurai. Come on now, the last samurai is Tom Cruise. Really? :: 279 :: Lisa Cosgrove :: 280 :: 27 June 2010 :: 281 :: <STRONG> Jackie Chan is the only reason to see it </STRONG> :: 282 :: Jaden Smith seemed lost and appeared as an amateur. They took tidbits from the original Karate Kid and tried to adapt it to a younger audience, but missed the target miserably. The fight sequences appear staged, not smooth. Jackie Chans fight scene with the young punks is the only reason that anyone should check this movie out. In all honesty, I felt awkward watching Jaden Smith trying to be a headliner, when all along, the movie should have been directed towards Jackie Chan. I think it would have been better had they done what was done in Batman Begins, and shown how the mentor came to be. :: 283 :: Wilson Woodson :: 284 :: 24 June 2010 :: 285 :: <STRONG> THERE IS ONLY ONE TRUE KARATE KID!!! </STRONG> :: 286 :: YET ANOTHER PRIME EXAMPLE OF A HOLLYWOOD POWER TRIP. BIG MOVIE EXECS AND PRODUCERS WITH MONEY STRIKE AGAIN AT ANOTHER CLASSIC THAT COULD NEVER BE TOPPED. THIS ATTEMPT IS JUST SAD IN MY OPINION FROM EVERY ASPECT, I HAVE NEVER EVEN SEEN THIS GARBAGE AND WONT WASTE MY TIME EITHER (UNFORTUNATELY I DID SEE THE PREVIEW WICH TOLD ME MORE THAN I WANTED TO KNOW)! THERE IS ONLY ONE KARATE KID THAT WILL BE SEEN IN MY HOUSE AND THAT MOVE WAS MADE IN 1984 AND SHOWCASED A REAL CHILD STAR BY THE NAME OF RALPH MACCHIO, NOT A SHOE-IN TO THE MOVIE INDUSTRY BECAUSE OF DADDYS STATUS. HOLLYWOOD WILL NEVER STOP AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK, AS WE HAVE ALL SEEN RECENTLY AND YEARS PAST. ALL WE CAN DO IS REFUSE TO SUPPORT THE EFFORT TO TARNISH GREAT CLASSICS AND MAKE THE RICH EVEN MORE WEALTHY THAN ALREADY ARE. GREED, EXCESS, AND ABUSE SEEMS TO BE THE TREND IN HOLLYWOOD THESE DAYS ALONG WITH A SEVERE LACK OF CREATIVE KNOWLEDGE, AND I FOR ONE WILL NEVER SUCCUMB TO THIS NEW WAY OF ENTERTAINMENT. TONIGHT THE FANS REVOLT!!! :: 287 :: Latasha Sterling :: 288 :: 23 June 2010 :: 289 :: <STRONG> Great Movie! </STRONG> :: 290 :: I loved the movie for the story it told -- Children (and adults) learning respect for others and also to have descipline in their lives. I thought the acting was very well done. The scenery in and around China was done very well I enjoyed looking at it again. I visited China a few years ago and enjoyed seeing places I have been. I will definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD. :: 291 :: Grace Jones :: 292 :: 16 June 2010 :: 293 :: <STRONG> I wish Will Smith would learn how to title movies </STRONG> :: 294 :: I really bugs me that Will Smith steals titles from books and makes movies that bear little resemblance to those books. He did that with I Robot and I am Legend Trust me the books are worth a read. His movies are not bad but the tile rip-off Pies me off.....but I digress. The movie actually does sort of follow the original movie except it is set in China. It reveals an amazing talent in Wills son Jadin Smith. It is not his first role but it will be a memorable one. It is hard to like his character as he is self-obsessed and delusional. We dont have a time line for his training but he certainly learned a lot from the jacket. I personally liked the wax-on...wax-ff) routine in the original movie. Jackie Chan is great in the movie...small comedic glimpses but an excellent dramatic performance. I was not impressed with the mothers role in the movie. I cant say that any mother could watch her son almost destroyed then cheer him on when he comes back....did not seem realistic to me. OVERALL I enjoyed the movie. I have been to China and the parks shown in the movie are the real McCoy...amazing places to go to. :: 295 :: Linda Vargas :: 296 :: 15 June 2010 :: 297 :: <STRONG> Criticism of title silly </STRONG> :: 298 :: There have been many critiques of the title - get over it. Since whenhas a title ever influenced your opinion of a movie? This movie is an excellent remake of the original. Who knew Jackie Chancould act? Hopefully we see a lot more dramatic parts for him ratherthan the tongue-in-cheek caricature of an action star that he hasbecome. There are a lot of criticisms of Jaden Smith that I have seen and theyare completely unwarranted. His performance at age 10 or 11 isphenomenal. His physical capabilities are a huge plus. There are a fewidiots that believe the original was a superior film. Jaden Smith isphysically more believable at 11 than Ralph Maccio was at age 23(?). This was enjoyable for the whole family and a pleasant surprise. If youwant criticize the film because its a remake or predictable - why didyou go see it? Picking on this film is ridiculous. Just go and enjoy. :: 299 :: Lanny Mccoy :: 300 :: 13 June 2010 :: 301 :: <STRONG> Great! </STRONG> :: 302 :: My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. Jackie Chan was good and I really liked Jadens acting. The story line was better then we had anticipated based on some of the other reviews. :: 303 :: Tiffany Jones :: 304 :: 12 June 2010 :: 305 :: <STRONG> Beautiful Story of Tenacity </STRONG> :: 306 :: I loved this story and the beautiful visuals. It had me on the edge of my seat. Jayden and Jackie were great, so was T. Henson. I loved the Asian actress (sweet) and the villian REALLY played his part. He made me to hate him. This is a great movie to show kids about never giving up. :: 307 :: Daniel Smith :: 308 :: 11 June 2010 :: 309 :: <STRONG> Remake done Really Right! I would see it again! </STRONG> :: 310 :: Its been a long time since I have been to a movie that I have enjoyed as much as this Karate Kid (2010). When I first heard that a remake of Karate Kid was coming out I was less then thrilled with yet another remake. I was wondering why Hollywood would want to improve on the 1984 Karate Kid. But they did and they did it well!. I sure am glad I saw this movie. My 11 year old daughter enjoyed it too and laughed and also cheered on the hero throughout the movie. I would see this movie again and for me thats something that does not happen often. Great movie!! :: 311 :: 	More Movies :: 312 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_373220.jpg :: 313 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 314 :: 	The Tourist (LQ) :: 315 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 316 :: 	Action, Thriller, Drama :: 317 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_372524.jpg :: 318 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 319 :: 	TRON: Legacy (LQ) :: 320 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 321 :: 	Action, Thriller, Adventure :: 322 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_367011.jpg :: 323 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 324 :: 	The Warrior's Way (LQ) :: 325 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 326 :: 	Action, Fantasy, Western :: 327 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_365406.jpg :: 328 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 329 :: 	Faster (LQ) :: 330 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 331 :: 	Action, Crime, Thriller :: 332 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_357188.jpg :: 333 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 334 :: 	Unstoppable :: 335 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 336 :: 	Action, Comedy, Drama :: 337 :: 	Copyright MoviesPlanet.com Â© 2002-2010 All Rights Reserved. :: 338 :: 	Support :: 339 :: 	/support.html :: 340 :: 	| :: 341 :: 	Privacy Policy :: 342 :: 	/privacy-policy.html :: 343 :: 	| :: 344 :: 	Terms of Use :: 345 :: 	/terms-of-use.html :: 346 :: 	| :: 347 :: 	FAQ :: 348 :: 	/faq.html :: 349 :: 	| :: 350 :: 	Help :: 351 :: 	/help.htm :: 352 :: 	Expand :: 353 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-the-karate-kid-movie-8098.html# :: 354 :: 	next :: 355 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-the-karate-kid-movie-8098.html# :: 356 :: 	previous :: 357 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-the-karate-kid-movie-8098.html# :: 358 :: 	Close :: 359 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-the-karate-kid-movie-8098.html# :: 360 :: 	Previous :: 361 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-the-karate-kid-movie-8098.html# :: 362 :: 	0/0 :: 363 :: 	Next :: 364 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-the-karate-kid-movie-8098.html# :: 365 ::

Everythings fantastic until a seriously mind-blowing, dangerously fashionable, roller blading delivery girl named Ramona Flowers starts cruising through his dreams and sailing by him at parties. But the path to Ms. Flowers isnt covered in rose petals. Ramonas seven evil exes stand between Scott and true happiness. Can Scott defeat all seven of the bad guys and get the girl without turning his precious little life upside-down, before the game is over?DVD and HD 720p PC, Mac, PS3 and XBOX 360 COMPATIBLE :: 218 :: 	Movie Photo :: 219 :: 	1-26	Peter Ardito :: 254 :: 29 August 2010 :: 255 :: <STRONG> Zany, inventive, fun film about fickle young love in a slacker-style arcade-themed world </STRONG> :: 256 :: Scott Pilgrim, Canadian slacker, has broken hearts before and had his own heart broken one too many times, but now he seems to have reached a new low. Hes 22, between jobs and playing bass in a not-so-great band, and hes dating a high schooler. Sure, her name is Knives Chow, which everyone has to admit is kind of a cool name, and shes got mad skills in the arcade - but they havent even kissed, and they probably shouldnt, and everyone around him knows this is not really moving on, and its not fair to the young woman whose heart he is sure to break. Sure enough, he does decide to move on the moment he sets eyes on the colorful and enigmatic girl of his dreams but shes got some serious baggage. In order to date her, he has to defeat, in arcade game style mortal combat, her seven evil exes (all played with panache by a number of cameo stars). Its like a colorfully stylized musical, except instead of breaking into song when conflicts arise or emotions boil, they break out impossible kungfu moves, complete with colorful Batman-tv-era kerplunks and pows written onto the screen. I read a New York Times review from an unimpressed game critic who seemed to want it to mean something, or to better reflect the reality of contemporary video games. Maybe it doesnt do those things, but I dont think it needs to. My wife and I saw it and walked out enchanted and amused. (My only complaint is that I thought Scott Pilgrim and Knives Chow were in fact a far better match than he and the bright-haired Ramona Flowers. I just never saw the sparks between Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winstead - so that in this unrealistic fantasy that was the one thing that really felt fake.) Hollywood will always be telling love stories - and I hope that every once in a while they get around to making them as inventive and funny as Edgar Wright managed to make this one. :: 257 :: Jessie Hitt :: 258 :: 28 August 2010 :: 259 :: <STRONG> I Walked Out Because It Was Stupid </STRONG> :: 260 :: I dont usually walk out of a movie but with this one I did. I should not always listen to the Critics because they can be oh so wrong like in this case. I kept thinking after 30 wasted minutes....what am I doing? There are much better movies to see. This one just made no sense and I walked out and saw another much better movie....The Expendables and I felt so much better for doing that!!!!!! :: 261 :: Teresa Schwartz :: 262 :: 27 August 2010 :: 263 :: <STRONG> Wow, please save yourself from this movie! </STRONG> :: 264 :: Okay, what a bummer!!! First off, I LOVE the creativity that went into this film, as well as the spunk. But that aside, there WAS NO PLOT!!!! IT WAS LAME. NO PLOT. So sad. Could have been an amazing movie. In addition to that, a little too much homo stuff for me. That aside, really just had no plot. I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I left feeling like I lost a part of my brain, somehow it shrunk during this movie. :: 265 :: Viola Sharer :: 266 :: 24 August 2010 :: 267 :: <STRONG> Should have titled it Scott Pilgrim Conquers the world </STRONG> :: 268 :: In this day of age hollywood has done nothing but remake, sequaled, adapted pointless films whether its based on a tv show, book, video game, etc. A good majority of them sucked. The video game movie business is not doing well at all. When you hear the words video game movie your ears instantly hurt. But here comes a movie called Scott Pilgrim vs the world that is based off a comic book series that is inspired by many comic books and video game series. At first I thought I was going to hate this movie because it had actor Michael Cera play the main character and it seemed that every movie hes in he plays the same character The quiet nerdy virgin character. Well after seeing the first 5 minutes of the movie I was totally BLOWN AWAY!!! Everything is perfect about this movie! This is what I call a video gamecomic book movie that is done RIGHT! The Goods The comedy is hillarious! The characters are entertaining The fight scenes are excellent, the best Ive seen in a long time The special affects blow my mind, I consider them better than the movie Avatars special effects much better The villians just make my funny bones burst The plot is perfect, even when the movie tries to cram all 6 books into one movie. You would think that would destroy the movie, but they actually did a very good job at ballancing the film. The bad side This movie was made on a budget of 80-90 million.....This movie is barely making 20 million. IT DESERVES MORE MONEY! Overall, this movie is awesome. Its deffinatly on my top 10 list of greatest movie ever made. It must be otherwise I wouldnt write a review for it or already pre-order the blue ray disk. :: 269 :: Dusty Mckee :: 270 :: 23 August 2010 :: 271 :: <STRONG> A fun film but not an epic win </STRONG> :: 272 :: This did give some laughs and the video game references did make me smile, but it wasnt enough to get me cheering. The idea for the film was good and the characters were fairly interesting but I didnt feel myself caring or rooting for anyone except the side character knives who seemed to do the most of the growthchange in the story in my opinion. Worth a watch, but I felt it was worth a matinee watch. :: 273 :: Kelly Rae :: 274 :: 21 August 2010 :: 275 :: <STRONG> One of the Best Movies I have Seen In a Long Time! </STRONG> :: 276 :: This movie was definitely an epic of epic epicness. The movie has great music, great video game graphics, and actors. This movie was worth writing a review for just because it was so good. I would recommend this movie to anyone, and I would definitely recommend seeing it with a friend. ) :: 277 :: Myron Herbst :: 278 :: 20 August 2010 :: 279 :: <STRONG> Wasted Potential </STRONG> :: 280 :: The storys premise has a lot of potential. Iw as wanting a reason for the battlign of evil exes other than a vague existential feel of romantic partners eneding to grapple with who their partner was and allowing them to be who they are now as separate entitites. The league never has a rhyme or reason for its purpose or motivation, or evne for its existence. The battling is done in the real world, when clearly Ceras character is devoid of real world abilities, and locked into competition of a Mario Brothers, Street Fighter, and Battle Toad environment and anachronistic gaming. The constant spamming of demeaning homosexual cliches such as the roommate being a complete manwhore and stealing others partners was merely one of a few attempts to cash-in on stereotypical roles which inhibited actors from acting. There was no character growth, only flat, one-faced cartoon characters who yielded no life or support to a film whose story rang hollow and forgettable. One saving grace for this film is the mindless comedy most of us went to the film to see. If you can forget about any linear sense of the movie, and get past the heavy-handed attempt at strong romantic philosophy, you can definitely have a few laughs at characters expense. The visual effects again showed a potential, yet were constantly shifting from powder, coins, shimmering hearts, cartoon-strip flashbacks, and terribly put-together combat scenes which neither looked video-gamey enoguh to be a video game or realistic enoguh to be real combat. The end result is a live-action Power Puff Girl that has neither the lack of regard for realism to go all the way in visual effects and fight choreography, nor enough of a hold on realism to make anything moment in any fight suspenseful or enjoyable. Youre always waiting for the trump-cards lame ending to a combat scene you were never impressed by. What could have been a great take on the comic strip and mesh in with modern gamer culture leaves its audience underwhelmed and in need of medicinal aid. If youre an old school nintendo gamer, youll appreciate allusions throughout the text. If youre a tennie-bopper, you may be impressed. If youre on drugs, or are prepared for the lack of execution and story holes, or if you simply want to waste some time staring at some pretty colors without point or purpose, youll get a kick out of this film. I felt that it failed to perform, and Iw as hoping it would be a cult classic. This is coming from a guy who did like Blades of Glory and Army of Darkness, so the lack of story and acting is massive. :: 281 :: Conrad Caison :: 282 :: 19 August 2010 :: 283 :: <STRONG> Terrible waste of time </STRONG> :: 284 :: Stupid and boring movie.Should have been an after school special.Except they would have to take out all the references to gay sex.I guess if you are a nerdy brain dead 13 year old this may be the movie for you. :: 285 :: Jeri Charles :: 286 :: 18 August 2010 :: 287 :: <STRONG> Original and Hilarious </STRONG> :: 288 :: I laughed until I cried, literally, and its been a long time since a movie had that effect on me. This movie is almost painfully original in both its story and execution. Pilgrims combination of Juno-esque delivery, comic book stylized action, and pop culture references make for absolute non-stop entertainment and absurdly memorable characters. Its a shame it wont make the money it deserves, people are missing out on a really good time here. :: 289 :: Joshua Scott :: 290 :: 17 August 2010 :: 291 :: <STRONG> Facinating! </STRONG> :: 292 :: It was like reading a comic, playing a video game, and watching a movie... All at the same time!!! It might be confusing to people have a hard time paying attention to movies, but if youre used to things that are fast paced youll get a lot more out of it. :: 293 :: Agnes Tobias :: 294 :: 15 August 2010 :: 295 :: <STRONG> Creative </STRONG> :: 296 :: This movie will not be for everyone. I liked it and when I saw it it seemed that the younger people enjoyed it and the older ones did not get it. If you are a gamer and are familiar with the look and sounds of the games you will laugh at much of this movie. It is a fantasy that plays out like a video game. There are scores when the fights happen. It was fun and very creative. :: 297 :: James Edgar :: 298 :: 14 August 2010 :: 299 :: <STRONG> WOW! </STRONG> :: 300 :: This movie had a familiar beginning of a Michael cera movie. A dorky teen falls in love with a girl and thats the only thing predictable about this movie. Visually, it was fantasic. The story and actors were so great and fit the movie so well. Overall, Id say this is one of the best movies of the year. Maybe of all time... :: 301 :: Jonathan Root :: 302 :: 13 August 2010 :: 303 :: <STRONG> What a fantastic story!! A MUST SEE of must see!! </STRONG> :: 304 :: WOW! What a fantastic story! As a parent of a teen, I am probably outside the demographic for this movie but from my point of view there so many threads for parents to talk with their children about. Love, courage and sticking to your dream, and many more. No nudity, and the language was distracted by the amazing visuals on screen. No drugs or alcohol either, plus the characters are over 21. Your children will have to explain the visuals if you avoided learning any gaming skills. Amazing amazing amazing story... IF you ever want to talk to your children about the serious side of getting closer to adulthood see this movie! Plus I havent laughed so hard from a movie script in a very long time. The croud really got into the story and the pacing is fantastic - edited to perfection. Amazing songs also. :: 305 :: 	More Movies :: 306 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_373220.jpg :: 307 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 308 :: 	The Tourist (LQ) :: 309 :: 	/watch-the-tourist-lq-movie-12594.html :: 310 :: 	Action, Thriller, Drama :: 311 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_372524.jpg :: 312 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 313 :: 	TRON: Legacy (LQ) :: 314 :: 	/watch-tron-legacy-lq-movie-12554.html :: 315 :: 	Action, Thriller, Adventure :: 316 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_367011.jpg :: 317 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 318 :: 	The Warrior's Way (LQ) :: 319 :: 	/watch-the-warriors-way-lq-movie-12249.html :: 320 :: 	Action, Fantasy, Western :: 321 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_365406.jpg :: 322 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 323 :: 	Faster (LQ) :: 324 :: 	/watch-faster-lq-movie-12164.html :: 325 :: 	Action, Crime, Thriller :: 326 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com:80/images/cache/thumb_design4_image_357188.jpg :: 327 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 328 :: 	Unstoppable :: 329 :: 	/watch-unstoppable-movie-11730.html :: 330 :: 	Action, Comedy, Drama :: 331 :: 	Copyright MoviesPlanet.com Â© 2002-2010 All Rights Reserved. :: 332 :: 	Support :: 333 :: 	/support.html :: 334 :: 	| :: 335 :: 	Privacy Policy :: 336 :: 	/privacy-policy.html :: 337 :: 	| :: 338 :: 	Terms of Use :: 339 :: 	/terms-of-use.html :: 340 :: 	| :: 341 :: 	FAQ :: 342 :: 	/faq.html :: 343 :: 	| :: 344 :: 	Help :: 345 :: 	/help.htm :: 346 :: 	Expand :: 347 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-aka-scott-pilgrims-precious-little-life-movie-9792.html# :: 348 :: 	next :: 349 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-aka-scott-pilgrims-precious-little-life-movie-9792.html# :: 350 :: 	previous :: 351 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-aka-scott-pilgrims-precious-little-life-movie-9792.html# :: 352 :: 	Close :: 353 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-aka-scott-pilgrims-precious-little-life-movie-9792.html# :: 354 :: 	Previous :: 355 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-aka-scott-pilgrims-precious-little-life-movie-9792.html# :: 356 :: 	0/0 :: 357 :: 	Next :: 358 :: 	http://www.soulfilms.com/watch-scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-aka-scott-pilgrims-precious-little-life-movie-9792.html# :: 359 ::

My Critical Perspective C- My Personal Perspective B+ 70100 First of all, if you dont know about Jackass, you need to be prepared for a movie with no point at all. Jackass is the third movie installment based on the popular MTV series with the same name that ran from 2000 to 2002. The cast includes Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Chris Pontius, Steve-O, Ryan Dunn, Jason Wee-Man Acua, Preston Lacy, Dave England, and Ehren McGhehey. Therefore, even though the show was only on TV for three seasons summing to 25 episodes, the antics did not end there. In 2002, Jackass The Movie was released, followed by Jackass Number Two in 2006 along with numerous TV shows created by different cast members including Viva La Bam, Dr. Steve-O, Wildboyz, and Homewrecker. Four years after their last meeting in their second film these crazy men are back together in the latest Jackass movie in 3D! The film follows these characters as they beat the living hell out of each other while performing a series of hilarious, disgusting, disturbing and dangerous pranks. The Good This is the first film that has used 3D in a way that makes the film worth seeing in 3D. The implementation of 3D adds to the party and along with another dimension to the film. It allows all of the pranks to be bigger, better, funnier and more entertaining by immersing the audience into the world of Jackass. The opening and closing scenes of the film abuse the use of 3D especially well through slow motion effects and exceptional cinematography (yes I did just say that). The stunts in the film are at a whole new level that the TV series or the previous films have not been able to capture. The stunts are so crazy and ridiculous in the film that they will leave the entire audience wondering How are they all still alive? While no sane human being would be attempting these stunts in the first place leading to the fact that all of the actors mentioned earlier and especially Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Wee-man and Steve-O are all one of a kind maniacs that prove that they are four of the craziest and most entertaining men in the world (or are they just stupid?). The Bad There is no plot at all to this film and contains a specific type of humor that isnt for everyone. There are a lot of sexually oriented pranks in some shape or form. The film targets a very small audience that includes males ages 18 to 35 and even in this demographic the movie isnt for everyone. The film is extremely disgusting to the point where multiple scenes are unwatchable to the extent of gagging. Nothing is off limits in the film and therefore there is no limit to how gross the film gets and no limit on how long the scenes last. The disgusting aspect of the film ranges from scenes with male nudity to other scenes with different forms of bodily waste. Jackass has always been this way and when it comes to male nudity there is significantly less nudity in this film than in Jackass Number Two, which was more of a male nudity fest. Just be prepared for what you are getting yourself into before seeing this film. Final Thought The Jackass TV series and Jackass 3D in general takes an acquired taste and the right mood to enjoy. I cannot recommend this film because you already know if you want to see it or not. Therefore, I recommend that if you want to see it on the big screen in 3D see it now, otherwise, dont see it if you think its going to be a tame Jackass film. :: 259 :: Matthew Vergara :: 260 :: 26 October 2010 :: 261 :: <STRONG> DUMB ASS?
